ZMQ Broker
**********

.. versionadded:: 2.9

The ZMQ broker is AiiDA's built-in message broker, replacing the need for an external RabbitMQ service.
It implements the subset of AMQP semantics that AiiDA requires (tasks, RPC, broadcasts) using ZeroMQ as the transport layer.

This page documents the internal architecture for developers working on the broker itself.
For user-facing documentation, see the :ref:`installation guide <installation:guide-complete:broker:zmq>`.


Process and thread architecture
===============================

When ``verdi daemon start`` is run with a ZMQ-configured profile, circus launches two types of processes:

.. code-block:: text

    verdi daemon start
    └── circus (daemon supervisor)
        ├── verdi devel zmq-broker      ← broker process (1 instance)
        │   └── ZmqBrokerService
        │       └── ZmqBrokerServer     (single-threaded, zmq.Poller event loop)
        │           └── PersistentQueue (file-based task durability)
        │
        └── verdi daemon worker         ← worker process(es) (1..N instances)
            └── Runner
                └── ZmqBroker
                    └── ZmqCommunicator
                        ├── main thread     (public API: task_send, rpc_send, ...)
                        └── loop thread     (private asyncio loop with ZMQ DEALER socket)

Key points:

- The **broker process** is single-threaded.
  ``ZmqBrokerServer`` uses a ``zmq.Poller`` event loop (non-blocking I/O via epoll/kqueue underneath) — no asyncio, no threads.
- Each **worker process** creates a ``ZmqCommunicator`` that runs a private asyncio event loop on a dedicated **background thread**.
  All ZMQ socket I/O happens on that thread; public methods schedule work via ``call_soon_threadsafe``, so no locks are needed.
- The broker process is started **before** workers by circus, so its IPC socket is ready when workers connect.
  If it isn't ready yet, ``get_communicator()`` polls until the socket file appears.

Endpoint discovery
==================

Unlike RabbitMQ, the ZMQ broker requires no connection configuration (no host, port, or credentials).
Discovery is file-based: both sides derive the broker directory from the profile UUID.

1. On startup, the broker process writes the IPC socket path to ``~/.aiida/broker/{profile-uuid}/broker.sockets``.
2. When a worker calls ``get_communicator()``, it reads that file to obtain the endpoint (e.g. ``ipc:///tmp/aiida_zmq_xyz/router.sock``).
3. The worker connects its DEALER socket to that endpoint.

This means the ZMQ broker is **local-only** — IPC sockets do not work across machines.
For distributed setups (workers on different hosts), use RabbitMQ.


Socket architecture
===================

All traffic flows through a single ZMQ ROUTER/DEALER socket pair over IPC:

.. code-block:: text

    ┌──────────────────────┐          ┌──────────────────────┐
    │   Worker process 1   │          │   Worker process 2   │

                 │  ┌────────────────────┐  │
                 │  │   ROUTER socket    │  │
                 │  │  (sync, zmq.Poller)│  │
                 │  └────────────────────┘  │
                 │  ┌────────────────────┐  │
                 │  │  PersistentQueue   │  │
                 │  │  (disk storage)    │  │
                 │  └────────────────────┘  │
                 └──────────────────────────┘

The ROUTER socket auto-prepends the sender's identity to incoming frames, enabling the broker to route replies back to specific clients.
``ROUTER_MANDATORY`` is set so that sending to a disconnected identity raises ``ZMQError`` immediately rather than silently dropping the message.


Message protocol
================

The protocol is defined in ``protocol.py``.
All messages are JSON-encoded dicts sent as single ZMQ frames.
Every message has a ``type`` field (a ``MessageType`` enum value) and an ``id`` (UUID hex).

Message types
-------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 20 55

   * - Message type
     - Direction
     - Purpose
   * - ``TASK``
     - client → broker → worker
     - Submit a task for processing. Contains ``body``, ``sender``, ``no_reply``.
   * - ``TASK_ACK``
     - worker → broker
     - Acknowledge successful receipt/completion. Broker removes task from persistent queue.
   * - ``TASK_NACK``
     - worker → broker
     - Negative acknowledgment. Broker requeues the task for redelivery.
   * - ``TASK_RESPONSE``
     - worker → broker → client
     - Return the result of a completed task. Broker forwards to original sender.
   * - ``RPC``
     - client → broker → recipient
     - Remote procedure call to a named recipient. Broker routes by subscriber ID.
   * - ``RPC_RESPONSE``
     - recipient → broker → client
     - Return RPC result. Broker forwards to original caller.
   * - ``BROADCAST``
     - client → broker → all
     - Fan-out to all connected clients (derived from subscriber registries).
   * - ``SUBSCRIBE_TASK``
     - worker → broker
     - Register as a task consumer. Broker adds worker to dispatch pool.
   * - ``UNSUBSCRIBE_TASK``
     - worker → broker
     - Deregister as a task consumer.
   * - ``SUBSCRIBE_RPC``
     - worker → broker
     - Register as an RPC handler under a given identifier.
   * - ``UNSUBSCRIBE_RPC``
     - worker → broker
     - Deregister as an RPC handler.
   * - ``PING``
     - broker → worker
     - Liveness probe. Worker ignores it; failure to deliver (``EHOSTUNREACH``) tells the broker the peer is dead.

AMQP mapping
------------

The protocol maps AMQP concepts to ZMQ message types:

.. code-block:: text

    AMQP concept              ZMQ broker equivalent
    ────────────────────────  ──────────────────────────────────
    basic.ack                 TASK_ACK
    basic.nack                TASK_NACK
    consumer with prefetch    TASK dispatch to available workers
    fanout exchange           BROADCAST via ROUTER fan-out
    direct exchange           RPC routed to named recipient
    durable queue             PersistentQueue (file-based)
    basic.consume             SUBSCRIBE_TASK / SUBSCRIBE_RPC

Wire format
-----------

Messages travel as ZMQ multipart frames:

.. code-block:: text

    Client (DEALER) sends:        [ empty-delimiter | json-payload ]
    Broker (ROUTER) receives:     [ client-identity | empty-delimiter | json-payload ]
    Broker (ROUTER) sends:        [ target-identity | empty-delimiter | json-payload ]

The empty delimiter frame is a ZMQ convention for ROUTER/DEALER interop.
The ROUTER socket automatically prepends the sender's identity on receive and uses the first frame as the routing target on send.

Payload fields like ``body`` and ``result`` are opaque to the broker — they are pre-encoded by the sender (typically as YAML strings by plumpy/kiwipy) and passed through without inspection.


Message flow: task submission
=============================

.. code-block:: text

    verdi run / submit()          Worker (daemon)            Broker
    ────────────────────          ───────────────            ──────

          │                             │  (process runs...)   │
          │                             │                      │
          │                             │──── TASK_ACK ───────▶│  ack: remove from queue
          │                             │──── TASK_RESPONSE ──▶│
          │                             │                      │
          │◀────────────── TASK_RESPONSE (forwarded) ──────────│
          │                             │                      │

Key details:

- The broker persists the task to disk **before** dispatching it.
  If the broker crashes, tasks are recovered from disk on restart.
- Workers delay the ACK until the task Future resolves.
  If a worker dies before ACK'ing, the broker detects the disconnect (via ZMTP heartbeats + PING probing) and requeues the task.
- If ``no_reply=True``, no TASK_RESPONSE is sent.


Dead peer detection
===================

The broker uses three mechanisms to detect dead workers:

1. **ZMTP heartbeats** — the ROUTER socket sends periodic heartbeat frames (every ``HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL``).
   If no response within ``HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT``, ZMQ fires a disconnect event.
2. **Monitor socket** — the broker listens for ``EVENT_DISCONNECTED`` on a monitor socket attached to the ROUTER.
   On disconnect, it probes all workers with assigned tasks.
3. **PING probing** — the broker sends a ``PING`` message to each worker identity with in-flight tasks.
   With ``ROUTER_MANDATORY``, sending to a dead identity raises ``ZMQError(EHOSTUNREACH)``, identifying the dead worker.
   Its tasks are then requeued.


Persistent queue (crash recovery)
=================================

``PersistentQueue`` stores tasks as individual JSON files:

.. code-block:: text

    {storage_path}/tasks/
    ├── pending/                      ← waiting to be dispatched
    │   └── {timestamp}_{id}.json
    └── processing/                   ← dispatched, awaiting ACK
        └── {timestamp}_{id}.json

- **push**: writes to ``pending/`` (atomic: write ``.tmp`` then ``rename``)
- **pop**: moves from ``pending/`` to ``processing/``
- **ack**: deletes from ``processing/``
- **nack**: moves back from ``processing/`` to ``pending/`` (front of queue for retry)
- **crash recovery**: on startup, all files in ``processing/`` are moved back to ``pending/``


Service files
=============

``ZmqBrokerService`` manages the broker process lifecycle and writes files that ``ZmqBroker`` (in worker processes) reads to discover the broker:

.. code-block:: text

    ~/.aiida/broker/{profile-uuid}/
    ├── broker.pid         "aiida-zmq-broker {pid}" — sentinel + PID for ownership check
    ├── broker.status      JSON with task counts, updated every STATUS_INTERVAL seconds
    ├── broker.sockets     path to the temp socket directory
    └── storage/           PersistentQueue data

    /tmp/aiida_zmq_{random}/
    └── router.sock        IPC socket (temp dir avoids 107-byte Unix path limit)


Timeouts
========

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 10 60

   * - Constant / option
     - Default
     - Purpose
   * - ``zmq.task_timeout`` |br| (``verdi config``)
     - 10s
     - How long a caller waits for a task or RPC response from the broker.
       Fires a ``TimeoutError`` on the pending Future. Analogous to ``rmq.task_timeout``.
   * - ``BROKER_READY_TIMEOUT``
     - 10s
     - How long ``get_communicator()`` polls for the broker to write its socket files at startup.
       A warning is logged after 5s.
   * - ``LOOP_TIMEOUT``
     - 5s
     - How long the main thread waits when scheduling work onto the communicator's background event loop.
       Fires if the loop thread is blocked or dead.
   * - ``LOOP_JOIN_TIMEOUT``
     - 3s
     - How long ``close()`` waits for the loop thread to shut down.
   * - ``HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL``
     - 2s
     - ZMTP heartbeat interval — how often the broker pings connected peers.
   * - ``HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT``
     - 6s
     - Peer considered dead after no heartbeat response for this duration.
   * - ``POLL_TIMEOUT``
     - 1s
     - Server-side ``zmq.Poller`` timeout per iteration. Controls how quickly the broker responds to shutdown signals.
   * - ``STATUS_INTERVAL``
     - 5s
     - How often the broker service writes its status JSON to disk.

Only ``zmq.task_timeout`` is user-configurable.
All other values are developer-tunable constants in ``defaults.py``.

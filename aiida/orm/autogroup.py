    """Class to automatically add all newly stored ``Node``s to an ``AutoGroup`` (whilst enabled).

    This class should not be instantiated directly, but rather accessed through the backend storage instance.

    The auto-grouping is checked by the ``Node.store()`` method which, if ``is_to_be_grouped`` is true,
    will store the node in the associated ``AutoGroup``.

    The exclude/include lists are lists of strings like:
    ``aiida.data:core.int``, ``aiida.calculation:quantumespresso.pw``,
    ``aiida.data:core.array.%``, ...
    i.e.: a string identifying the base class, followed by a colon and the path to the class
    as accepted by CalculationFactory/DataFactory.
    Each string can contain one or more wildcard characters ``%``;
    in this case this is used in a ``like`` comparison with the QueryBuilder.
    Note that in this case you have to remember that ``_`` means "any character"
    in the QueryBuilder, and you need to escape it if you mean a literal underscore.

    Only one of the two (between exclude and include) can be set.
    If none of the two is set, everything is included.

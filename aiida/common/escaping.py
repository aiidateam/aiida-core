def escape_for_bash(str_to_escape, use_double_quotes=False):
    """
    This function takes any string and escapes it in a way that
    bash will interpret it as a single string.

    Explanation:

    At the end, in the return statement, the string is put within single
    quotes. Therefore, the only thing that I have to escape in bash is the
    single quote character. To do this, I substitute every single
    quote ' with '"'"' which means:

    First single quote: exit from the enclosing single quotes

    Second, third and fourth character: "'" is a single quote character,
    escaped by double quotes

    Last single quote: reopen the single quote to continue the string

    Finally, note that for python I have to enclose the string '"'"'
    within triple quotes to make it work, getting finally: the complicated
    string found below.

    :param str_to_escape: the string to escape.
    :param use_double_quotes: boolean, if ``True``, use double quotes instead of single quotes.
    :return: the escaped string.

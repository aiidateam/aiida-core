    """Class to manage access to a profile.

    Any process that wants to request access for a given profile, should first call:

        ProfileAccessManager(profile).request_access()

    If this returns normally, the profile can be used safely. It will raise if it is locked, in which case the profile
    should not be used. If a process wants to request exclusive access to the profile, it should use ``lock``:

        with ProfileAccessManager(profile).lock():
            pass

    If the profile is already locked or is currently in use, an exception is raised.

    Access and locks of the profile will be recorded in a directory with files with a ``.pid`` and ``.lock`` extension,
    respectively. In principle then, at any one time, there can either be a number of pid files, or just a single lock
    file. If there is a mixture or there are more than one lock files, we are in an inconsistent state.

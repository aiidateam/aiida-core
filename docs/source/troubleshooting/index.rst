Increasing the debug level
==========================

By default, the logging level of AiiDA is minimal to avoid filling logfiles.
Only warnings and errors are logged to the daemon log files, while info and debug
messages are discarded.

If you are experiencing a problem, you can change the default minimum logging
level of AiiDA messages (and circus messages -- circus is the library that we
use to manage the daemon process) using, on the command line, the two
following commands::

  verdi devel setproperty logging.circus_loglevel DEBUG
  verdi devel setproperty logging.aiida_loglevel DEBUG

For each profile that runs a daemon, there will be two unique logfiles, one for
AiiDA log messages and one from the circus daemonizer. These files can be found
in the ``.aiida`` log folder, which by default can be found at ``~/.aiida/daemon/log/aiida_daemon.log``.
After rebooting the daemon (``verdi daemon restart``), the number of messages
logged will increase significantly and may help in understanding
the source of the problem. 

.. note:: In the command above, you can use a different level than ``DEBUG``.
  The list of the levels and their order is the same of the `standard python
  logging module <https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html#logging-levels>`_.

.. note:: When the problem is solved, we suggest to bring back the default
  logging level, using the two commands::

    verdi devel delproperty logging.circus_loglevel
    verdi devel delproperty logging.aiida_loglevel

  to avoid to fill the logfiles.

Tips to ease the life of the hard drive (for large databases)
=============================================================

Those tips are useful when your database is very large, i.e. several hundreds of
thousands of nodes and workflows or more. With such large databases the hard drive
may be constantly working and the computer slowed down a lot. Below are some
solutions to take care of the most typical reasons.

Repository backup
-----------------

The backup of the repository takes an extensively long time if it is done through
a standard rsync or backup software, since it contains as many folders as the number
of nodes plus the number of workflows (and each folder can contain many files!).
A solution is to use instead the incremental
backup described in the :ref:`repository backup section<repository_backup>`.


mlocate cron job
----------------

Under typical Linux distributions, there is a cron job (called 
``updatedb.mlocate``) running every day to update a database of files and 
folders -- this is to be used by the ``locate`` command. This might become 
problematic since the repository contains many folders and 
will be scanned everyday. The net effect is a hard drive almost constantly 
working.

To avoid this issue, edit as root the file ``/etc/updatedb.conf``
and put in ``PRUNEPATHS`` the name of the repository folder.

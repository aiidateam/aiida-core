#
# List of states from
# 'https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSETD4_9.1.2/lsf_command_ref/bjobs.1.dita'
#
# PEND    The job is pending. That is, it has not yet been started.
#
# PROV    The job has been dispatched to a power-saved host that is waking up.
#         Before the job can be sent to the sbatchd, it is in a PROV state.
#
# PSUSP   The job has been suspended, either by its owner or the LSF administrator,
#         while pending.
#
# RUN     The job is currently running.
#
# USUSP   The job has been suspended, either by its owner or the LSF administrator,
#         while running.
#
# SSUSP   The job has been suspended by LSF due to either of the following two
#         causes:
#         - The load conditions on the execution host or hosts have exceeded a
#           threshold according to the loadStop vector defined for the host or queue.
#         - The run window of the job’s queue is closed. See bqueues(1), bhosts(1),
#           and lsb.queues(5).
#
# DONE    The job has terminated with status of 0.
#
# EXIT    The job has terminated with a non-zero status – it may have been aborted
#         due to an error in its execution, or killed by its owner or the LSF
#         administrator.
#         For example, exit code 131 means that the job exceeded a configured
#         resource usage limit and LSF killed the job.
#
# UNKWN   mbatchd has lost contact with the sbatchd on the host on which the job runs.
#
# WAIT    For jobs submitted to a chunk job queue, members of a chunk job that
#         are waiting to run.
#
# ZOMBI   A job becomes ZOMBI if:
#         - A non-rerunnable job is killed by bkill while the sbatchd on the
#           execution host is unreachable and the job is shown as UNKWN.
#         - The host on which a rerunnable job is running is unavailable and the
#           job has been requeued by LSF with a new job ID, as if the job were submitted as a new job.
#         - After the execution host becomes available, LSF tries to kill the
#           ZOMBI job. Upon successful termination of the ZOMBI job, the job’s
#           status is changed to EXIT.
#         With MultiCluster, when a job running on a remote execution cluster
#         becomes a ZOMBI job, the execution cluster treats the job the same way
#         as local ZOMBI jobs. In addition, it notifies the submission cluster
#         that the job is in ZOMBI state and the submission cluster requeues the job.

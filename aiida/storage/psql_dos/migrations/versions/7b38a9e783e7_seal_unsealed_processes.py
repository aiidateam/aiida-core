"""Seal any process nodes that have not yet been sealed but should.

This should have been accomplished by the last step in the previous migration, but because the WHERE clause was
incorrect, not all nodes that should have been targeted were included. The problem is with the statement:

    attributes->>'process_state' NOT IN ('created', 'running', 'waiting')

The problem here is that this will yield `False` if the attribute `process_state` does not even exist. This will be the
case for legacy calculations like `InlineCalculation` nodes. Their node type was already migrated in `0020` but most of
them will be unsealed.

This is identical to migration django_0041

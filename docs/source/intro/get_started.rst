        Launch AiiDA with MyBinder


Installation
============

A working AiiDA installation consists of three core components:

* ``aiida-core``: The main python package and associated CLI ``verdi``.
* `PostgreSQL <https://www.postgresql.org>`_: A service which manages the database where we store generated data.
* `RabbitMQ <https://www.rabbitmq.com>`_: A service which manages communication with the processes that we run.

Each component may be installed separately, depending on your use case.
Here we first provide the simplest approaches for installation on your local computer.

.. panels::

    **Install from Conda**

    `Conda <https://docs.conda.io>`_ provides a cross-platform package management system, from which we can install all the basic components of the AiiDA infrastructure in an isolated environment:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ conda create -n aiida -c conda-forge aiida-core aiida-core.services
        $ conda activate aiida

    ---

    **Install with pip**

    ``aiida-core`` can be installed from `PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/aiida-core>`_.

    .. code-block:: console

        pip install aiida-core

    You will then need to install PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ depending on your operating system.

    .. container:: link-box

        :ref:`advanced installation <intro/install_advanced>`.

To initialise a database cluster with PostgreSQL and start the service:

.. code-block:: console

    $ initdb -D mylocal_db
    $ pg_ctl -D mylocal_db -l logfile start

We can then use the `quicksetup` command, to set up an AiiDA configuration profile and related data storage.

.. code-block:: console

    $ reentry scan
    $ verdi quicksetup
    Info: enter "?" for help
    Info: enter "!" to ignore the default and set no value
    Profile name: me
    Email Address (for sharing data): me@user.com
    First name: my
    Last name: name
    Institution: where-i-work

At this point you now have a working AiiDA environment, from which you can add and retrieve data.

.. tip::

    Enable tab completion of ``verdi`` commands in the terminal with:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ eval "$(_VERDI_COMPLETE=source verdi)"

In order to run computations, one additional step is required to start the services that manage these background processes:

.. code-block:: console

    $ rabbitmq-server -detached
    $ verdi daemon start

We can check that all services are running as expected using:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi status
    ✓ config dir:  /home/ubuntu/.aiida
    ✓ profile:     On profile me
    ✓ repository:  /home/ubuntu/.aiida/repository/me
    ✓ postgres:    Connected as aiida_qs_ubuntu_c6a4f69d255fbe9cdb7385dcdcf3c050@localhost:5432
    ✓ rabbitmq:    Connected to amqp://127.0.0.1?heartbeat=600
    ✓ daemon:      Daemon is running as PID 16430 since 2020-04-29 12:17:31

Awesome! You now have a fully operational installation from which to take the next steps!

Finally, to power down the services, you can run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi daemon stop
    $ pg_ctl stop

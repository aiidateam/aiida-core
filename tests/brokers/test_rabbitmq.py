    """Test that a ``DuplicateSubscriberError`` in ``ProcessLauncher._continue`` does not except the process.

    It is possible that when a daemon worker tries to continue a process, that a ``kiwipy.DuplicateSubscriberError`` is
    raised, which means that it already subscribed itself to be running that process.
    This can occur for at least two reasons:

        * The user manually recreated the process task, mistakenly thinking it had been lost
        * RabbitMQ requeues the task because the daemon worker lost its connection or did not respond to the
          heartbeat in time, and the task is sent to the same worker once it regains connection.

    In both cases, the actual task is still actually being run and we should not let this exception except the entire
    process. Unfortunately, these duplicate tasks still happen quite a lot when the daemon workers are under heavy load
    and we don't want a bunch of processes to be excepted because of this.

    In most cases, just ignoring the task wil be the best solution. In the end, the original task is likely to complete.
    If it turns out that the task actually got lost and the process is stuck, the user can find this error message in
    the logs and manually recreate the task, using for example ``verdi devel revive``.

    Note that this exception is only raised within a single worker, i.e., if another worker subscribes to the same
    process, that should not incur this inception and that is not what we are testing here. This test should therefore
    be ran with a single daemon worker.

    """A namedtuple to define a process handler report for a :class:`aiida.engine.BaseRestartWorkChain`.

    This namedtuple should be returned by a process handler of a work chain instance if the condition of the handler was
    met by the completed process. If no further handling should be performed after this method the `do_break` field
    should be set to `True`.
    If the handler encountered a fatal error and the work chain needs to be terminated, an `ExitCode` with
    non-zero exit status can be set. This exit code is what will be set on the work chain itself. This works because the
    value of the `exit_code` field returned by the handler, will in turn be returned by the `inspect_process` step and
    returning a non-zero exit code from any work chain step will instruct the engine to abort the work chain.

    :param do_break: boolean, set to `True` if no further process handlers should be called, default is `False`
    :param exit_code: an instance of the :class:`~aiida.engine.processes.exit_code.ExitCode` tuple.
        If not explicitly set, the default `ExitCode` will be instantiated,
        which has status `0` meaning that the work chain step will be considered
        successful and the work chain will continue to the next step.

    """Decorator to register a :class:`~aiida.engine.BaseRestartWorkChain` instance method as a process handler.

    The decorator will validate the `priority` and `exit_codes` optional keyword arguments and then add itself as an
    attribute to the `wrapped` instance method. This is used in the `inspect_process` to return all instance methods of
    the class that have been decorated by this function and therefore are considered to be process handlers.

    Requirements on the function signature of process handling functions. The function to which the decorator is applied
    needs to take two arguments:

        * `self`: This is the instance of the work chain itself
        * `node`: This is the process node that finished and is to be investigated

    The function body typically consists of a conditional that will check for a particular problem that might have
    occurred for the sub process. If a particular problem is handled, the process handler should return an instance of
    the :class:`aiida.engine.ProcessHandlerReport` tuple. If no other process handlers should be considered, the set
    `do_break` attribute should be set to `True`. If the work chain is to be aborted entirely, the `exit_code` of the
    report can be set to an `ExitCode` instance with a non-zero status.

    :param wrapped: the work chain method to register the process handler with
    :param priority: optional integer that defines the order in which registered handlers will be called during the
        handling of a finished process. Higher priorities will be handled first. Default value is `0`. Multiple handlers
        with the same priority is allowed, but the order of those is not well defined.
    :param exit_codes: single or list of `ExitCode` instances. If defined, the handler will return `None` if the exit
        code set on the `node` does not appear in the `exit_codes`. This is useful to have a handler called only when
        the process failed with a specific exit code.
    :param enabled: boolean, by default True, which will cause the handler to be called during `inspect_process`. When
        set to `False`, the handler will be skipped. This static value can be overridden on a per work chain instance
        basis through the input `handler_overrides`.

Pseudopotential families tutorial
=================================

What is a pseudopotential family
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As you might have seen in the previous ``PWscf`` tutorial, the procedure of 
attaching a pseudopotential file to each atomic species could be a bit tedious.
In many situations, you will not produce a different pseudopotential file 
for every calculation you do. 
More likely, when you start a project you will stick to a pseudopotential file 
for as long as possible. 
Moreover, in a high-throughput calculation, you will like to do calculation 
over several elements keeping the same functional.
That's also part of the reason why there are several projects 
(like `PSLibrary <http://qe-forge.org/gf/project/pslibrary/frs/>`_ 
or `GBRV <http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/gbrv/>`_ to name a few), 
that intend to develop a set of pseudopotentials 
that covers most of the periodic table for different functionals.

That's why we introduced the *pseudopotential families*. 
They are basically a set of pseudopotentials that are grouped together in a 
special type of AiiDA Group of nodes, with the requirement that at most one
pseudopotential can be present for a given chemical element.

Of course, no requirements are enforced on the complete coverage of the periodic
table (also because really complete pseudopotential sets for the whole periodic
table do not exist). In other words, this means that you can create a
pseudopotential family containing the pseudopotentials only for a few elements
that you are interested in.

.. note:: it is your responsibility to group together pseudopotentials of the
  same type, or obtained using the same functionals, approximations
  and/or levels of theory.

How to create a pseudopotential family
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Let's say for example that we want to create a family of LDA ultrasoft
pseudopotentials. As the first step, 
you need to get all the pseudopotential files in a single folder.
For your convenience, it is useful to use a common name for your files, 
for example with a structure like 'Element.a-short-description.UPF'.

The utility to upload a family of pseudopotentials is accessed via ``verdi``::

  verdi data upf uploadfamily path/to/folder name_of_the_family "some description for your convenience"

where ``path/to/folder`` is the path to the folder where you collected all the
UPF files that you want to add to the AiiDA database and to the family with
name ``name_of_the_family``, and the final parameter is a string that is
set in the ``description`` field of the group.

.. note:: This command will first check the MD5 checksum of each file, and
  it will not create a new UPFData node if the pseudopotential is already 
  present in the DB. In this case, it will simply add that UpfData node
  to the group with name ``name_of_the_family``.

.. note:: if you add the optional flag ``--stop-if-existing``, 
  the code will stop (without creating any new UPFData node, nor creating a group)
  if at least one of the files in the folder is already found in the AiiDA DB.

After the upload (which may take some seconds, so please be patient) 
the upffamily will be ready to be used.

Note that if you pass as ``name_of_the_family`` a name that already exists,
the pseudopotentials in the folder will be added to the existing group. The
code will raise an error if you try to add two (different) pseudopotentials for
the same element.

Get the list of existing families
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
If you want to know what are the pseudopotential families already existing in 
the DB, type::
   
   verdi data upf listfamilies

Add a ``-d`` (or ``--with-description``) flag if you want to read also the
description of the family.

You can also filter the groups to get only a list of those containing 
a set of given elements using the ``-e`` option. For instance, if you want
to get only the families containing the elements ``Ba``, ``Ti`` and ``O``, use::

   verdi data upf listfamilies -e Ba Ti O


For more help on the command line options, type::
   
   verdi data upf listfamilies -h


Manually loading pseudopotentials
=================================

If you do not want to use pseudopotentials from a family, it is also possible
to load them manually (even if this is, in general, discouraged by us).

A possible way of doing it is the following: we start by creating a list
of pseudopotential filenames that we need to use::

    raw_pseudos = [
       "Ba.pbesol-spn-rrkjus_psl.0.2.3-tot-pslib030.UPF",
       "Ti.pbesol-spn-rrkjus_psl.0.2.3-tot-pslib030.UPF",
       "O.pbesol-n-rrkjus_psl.0.1-tested-pslib030.UPF"]

(in this simple example, we expect the pseudopotentials to be in the same
folder of the script).
Then, we loop over the filenames and add them to the AiiDA database. The 
``get_or_create`` method checks if the pseudopotential is already in the
database (by checking its MD5 checksum) and either stores it, or just returns
the node already present in the database (the second value returned is a
boolean and tells us if the pseudo was already present or not).
We also store the returned nodes in a list (``pseudos_to_use``).

::

    UpfData = DataFactory('upf')
    pseudos_to_use = []

    for filename in raw_pseudos:
        absname = os.path.abspath(filename)
        pseudo, created = UpfData.get_or_create(absname,use_first=True)
        pseudos_to_use.append(pseudo)

As the last step, we make a loop over the pseudopotentials,
and attach its pseudopotential object to the calculation::

    for pseudo in pseudos_to_use:
        calc.use_pseudo(pseudo, kind=pseudo.element)

.. note:: when the pseudopotential is created, it is parsed and the elements
  to which it refers is stored in the database and can be accessed using the 
  ``pseudo.element`` property, as shown above.

        # This step is necessary because certain versions of `pymatgen` will not specify an explicit version of
        # `numpy` in its build requirements, and so the latest version will be used. This causes problems,
        # however, because this means that the compiled version of `pymatgen` can only be used with that version
        # of `numpy` or higher, since `numpy` only guarantees forward compatibility of the ABI. If we want to
        # run with an older version of `numpy`, we need to ensure that `pymatgen` is built with that same
        # version. This we can accomplish by installing the desired version of `numpy` manually and then calling
        # the install command for `pymatgen` with the `--no-build-isolation` flag. This flag will ensure that
        # build dependencies are ignored and won't be installed (preventing the most recent version of `numpy`
        # to be installed) and the build relies on those requirements already being present in the environment.
        # We also need to install `wheel` because otherwise the `pymatgen` build will fail because `bdist_wheel`
        # will not be available.

AiiDA (Ab Initio DAtabase)

--------------------------------------------------
This is the django implementation of AiiDA.

Here is a quick description of the start of the AiiDA project layout.

The directory tree (for now) is roughly as follows:

aiida/       -- top-level dir
 aiidadb/    -- django directory containing settings.py, manage.py, and
               ORM models, urls and views
 docs/      -- documentation directory
 SQL/       -- contains initial db creation scripts, a backup and
               restore script, and will eventually contain stored
               procedures if needed
 templates/ -- contains html, css, js, img elements for rendering the
               AiiDA site

The MySQL database is called aiidadb. See the creation script for this
in SQL/scripts/create_aiida_db.sql. aiidadj was an earlier database for
django specific tables, that is no longer being created. As the root
MySQL user, source this sql file from within MySQL.

To restore the version of the aiidab with all tables as currently
available in my developemnt tree, cd to SQL directory, and run:

$ python restore.py

It will ask for confirmation, and ask you to enter the aiida_user
password for aiidadb.

Now from the aiidadb directory, you can run the development server:

$ python manage.py runserver

and then you can browse to the following urls on your web browser:

http://localhost:8000/aiida/
http://localhost:8000/aiida/admin/

This is the just the start of the implementation of the full GUI. More
to be added soon.

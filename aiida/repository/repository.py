    """File repository.

    This class provides an interface to a backend file repository instance, but unlike the backend repository, this
    class keeps a reference of the virtual file hierarchy. This means that through this interface, a client can create
    files and directories with a file hierarchy, just as they would on a local file system, except it is completely
    virtual as the files are stored by the backend which can store them in a completely flat structure. This also means
    that the internal virtual hierarchy of a ``Repository`` instance does not necessarily represent all the files that
    are stored by repository backend. The repository exposes a mere subset of all the file objects stored in the
    backend. This is why object deletion is also implemented as a soft delete, by default, where the files are just
    removed from the internal virtual hierarchy, but not in the actual backend. This is because those objects can be
    referenced by other instances.

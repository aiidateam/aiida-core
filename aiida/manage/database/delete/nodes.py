    """
    Delete nodes by a list of pks.

    This command will delete not only the specified nodes, but also the ones that are
    linked to these and should be also deleted in order to keep a consistent provenance
    according to the rules explained in the concepts section of the documentation.
    In summary:

    1. If a DATA node is deleted, any process nodes linked to it will also be deleted.

    2. If a CALC node is deleted, any incoming WORK node (callers) will be deleted as
    well whereas any incoming DATA node (inputs) will be kept. Outgoing DATA nodes
    (outputs) will be deleted by default but this can be disabled.

    3. If a WORK node is deleted, any incoming WORK node (callers) will be deleted as
    well, but all DATA nodes will be kept. Outgoing WORK or CALC nodes will be kept by
    default, but deletion of either of both kind of connected nodes can be enabled.

    These rules are 'recursive', so if a CALC node is deleted, then its output DATA
    nodes will be deleted as well, and then any CALC node that may have those as
    inputs, and so on.

    :param pks: a list of the PKs of the nodes to delete
    :param bool force: do not ask for confirmation to delete nodes.
    :param int verbosity: 0 prints nothing,
                          1 prints just sums and total,
                          2 prints individual nodes.
    :param bool create_forward:
        This will delete all output data created by any deleted calculation.
    :param bool call_calc_forward:
        This will also delete all calculations called by any workflow that is going to
        be deleted. Note that when you delete a workflow, also all parent workflows are
        deleted (recursively). Therefore, setting this flag to True may delete
        calculations that are 'unrelated' to what has been chosen to be deleted, just
        because they are connected at some point in the backwards provenance. Use with
        care, and it is advisable to never combine it with force.
    :param bool call_work_forward:
        This will also delete all workflows called by any workflow that is going to
        be deleted. The same disclaimer as forward_calcs applies here as well.
    :param bool dry_run:
        Just perform a dry run and do not delete anything. Print statistics according
        to the verbosity level set.
    :param bool force:
        Do not ask for confirmation to delete nodes.

    Controlling caching
    -------------------

    Old Docs: This should also contain the contents of "Controlling caching" inside of developer_guide/core/caching.rst.
    You should include links to the other sections topics:provenance:caching: and how-to:run-codes:caching:, and in those sections as well.
    Example for topics:provenance:caching: If you want more details of the internal architecture instead, you can check out the :ref:`relevant subsection <internal_architecture:engine:caching>` in the engine documentation.

    # I am first migrating the wrongly declared returnlinks out of
    # the InlineCalculations.
    # This bug is reported #628 https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida_core/issues/628
    # There is an explicit check in the code of the inline calculation
    # ensuring that the calculation returns UNSTORED nodes.
    # Therefore, no cycle can be created with that migration!

    # this command:
    # 1) selects all links that
    #   - joins an InlineCalculation (or subclass) as input
    #   - joins a Data (or subclass) as output
    #   - is marked as a returnlink.
    # 2) set for these links the type to 'createlink'

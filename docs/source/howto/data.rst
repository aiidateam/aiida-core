How to work with data
*********************


.. _how-to:data:import:

Importing data
==============

AiiDA allows users to export data from their database into an export archive file, which can be imported into any other AiiDA database.
If you have an AiiDA export archive that you would like to import, you can use the ``verdi archive import`` command (see :ref:`the reference section<reference:command-line:verdi-archive>` for details).

.. note:: For information on exporting and importing data via AiiDA archives, see :ref:`"How to share data"<how-to:share:archives>`.

If, instead, you have existing data that are not yet part of an AiiDA export archive, such as files, folders, tabular data, arrays or any other kind of data, this how-to guide will show you how to import them into AiiDA.

To store any piece of data in AiiDA, it needs to be wrapped in a :py:class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.data.Data` node, such that it can be represented in the :ref:`provenance graph <topics:provenance>`.
There are different varieties, or subclasses, of this ``Data`` class that are suited for different types of data.
AiiDA ships with a number of built-in data types.
You can list these using the :ref:`verdi plugin<reference:command-line:verdi-plugin>` command.
Executing ``verdi plugin list aiida.data`` should display something like::

    Registered entry points for aiida.data:
    * array
    * bool
    * code
    * dict
    * float
    * folder
    * list
    * singlefile

    Info: Pass the entry point as an argument to display detailed information

As the output suggests, you can get more information about each type by appending the name to the command, for example, ``verdi plugin list aiida.data singlefile``::

    Description:

    The ``singlefile`` data type is designed to store a single file in its entirety.
    A ``singlefile`` node can be created from an existing file on the local filesystem in two ways.
    By passing the absolute path of the file:

        singlefile = SinglefileData(file='/absolute/path/to/file.txt')

    or by passing a filelike object:

        with open('/absolute/path/to/file.txt', 'rb') as handle:
            singlefile = SinglefileData(file=handle)

    The filename of the resulting file in the database will be based on the filename passed in the ``file`` argument.
    This default can be overridden by passing an explicit name for the ``filename`` argument to the constructor.

As you can see, the ``singlefile`` type corresponds to the :py:class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.data.singlefile.SinglefileData` class and is designed to wrap a single file that is stored on your local filesystem.
If you have such a file that you would like to store in AiiDA, you can use the ``verdi shell`` to create it:

.. code-block:: python

    SinglefileData = DataFactory('singlefile')
    singlefile = SinglefileData(file='/absolute/path/to/file.txt')
    singlefile.store()

The first step is to load the class that corresponds to the data type, which you do by passing the name (listed by ``verdi plugin list aiida.data``) to the :py:class:`~aiida.plugins.factories.DataFactory`.
Then we just construct an instance of that class, passing the file of interest as an argument.

.. note:: The exact manner of constructing an instance of any particular data type is type dependent.
    Use the ``verdi plugin list aiida.data <ENTRY_POINT>`` command to get more information for any specific type.

Note that after construction, you will get an *unstored* node.
This means that at this point your data is not yet stored in the database and you can first inspect it and optionally modify it.
If you are happy with the results, you can store the new data permanently by calling the :py:meth:`~aiida.orm.nodes.node.Node.store` method.
Every node is assigned a Universal Unique Identifier (UUID) upon creation and once stored it is also assigned a primary key (PK), which can be retrieved through the ``node.uuid`` and ``node.pk`` properties, respectively.
You can use these identifiers to reference and or retrieve a node.
Ways to find and retrieve data that have previously been imported are described in section :ref:`"How to find data"<how-to:data:find>`.

If none of the currently available data types, as listed by ``verdi plugin list``, seem to fit your needs, you can also create your own custom type.
For details refer to the next section :ref:`"How to add support for custom data types"<topics:data_types:plugin>`.


.. _how-to:data:find:

Finding and querying for data
=============================

Once you have successfully completed a series of workflows for your project, or have imported a dataset you are interested in, you want to quickly find the data that is relevant for your analysis.
The data in an AiiDA database is stored as a graph of connected entities, which can be easily *queried* with the :class:`~aiida.orm.querybuilder.QueryBuilder` class.

The :class:`~aiida.orm.querybuilder.QueryBuilder` lets you query your AiiDA database independently of the backend used under the hood.
Before starting to write a query, it helps to:

*   Know what you want to query for.
    In the language of databases, you need to tell the backend what *entity* you are looking for and optionally which of its properties you want to *project*.
    For example, you might be interested in the label of a calculation and the PK's of all its outputs.
*   Know the relationships between entities you are interested in.
    Nodes of an AiiDA graph (vertices) are connected with links (edges).
    A node can for example be either the input or output of another node, but also an ancestor or a descendant.
*   Know how you want to filter the results of your query.

Once you are clear about what you want and how you can get it, the :class:`~aiida.orm.querybuilder.QueryBuilder` will build an SQL-query for you.

There are two ways of using the :class:`~aiida.orm.querybuilder.QueryBuilder`:

#.  In the *appender* method, you construct your query step by step using the ``QueryBuilder.append()`` method.
#.  In the *queryhelp* approach, you construct a dictionary that defines your query and pass it to the :class:`~aiida.orm.querybuilder.QueryBuilder`.

Both APIs provide the same functionality - the appender method may be more suitable for interactive use, e.g., in the ``verdi shell``, whereas the queryhelp method can be useful in scripting.
In this section we will focus on the basics of the appender method.
For more advanced queries or more details on the queryhelp, see the :ref:`topics section on advanced querying <topics:database:advancedquery>`.

.. _how-to:data:find:select:

Selecting entities
------------------

Using the ``append()`` method of the :class:`~aiida.orm.querybuilder.QueryBuilder`, you can query for the entities you are interested in.
Suppose you want to query for calculation job nodes in your database:

.. code-block:: python

    from aiida.orm import QueryBuilder
    qb = QueryBuilder()       # Instantiating instance. One instance -> one query
    qb.append(CalcJobNode)    # Setting first vertex of path

If you are interested in instances of different classes, you can also pass an iterable of classes.
However, they have to be of the same ORM-type (e.g. all have to be subclasses of :class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.node.Node`):

.. code-block:: python

    qb = QueryBuilder()       # Instantiating instance. One instance -> one query
    qb.append([CalcJobNode, WorkChainNode]) # Setting first vertices of path, either WorkChainNode or Job.

.. note::

    Processes have both a run-time :class:`~aiida.engine.processes.process.Process` that executes them and a :class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.node.Node` that stores their data in the database (see the :ref:`corresponding topics section<topics:processes:concepts:types>` for a detailed explanation).
    The :class:`~aiida.orm.querybuilder.QueryBuilder` allows you to pass either the :class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.node.Node` class (e.g. :class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.process.calculation.calcjob.CalcJobNode`) or the :class:`~aiida.engine.processes.process.Process` class (e.g. :class:`~aiida.engine.processes.calcjobs.calcjob.CalcJob`), which will automatically select the right entity for the query.
    Using either :class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.process.calculation.calcjob.CalcJobNode` or :class:`~aiida.engine.processes.calcjobs.calcjob.CalcJob` will produce the same query results.

.. _how-to:data:find:results:

Retrieving results
------------------

Once you have *appended* the entity you want to query for to the :class:`~aiida.orm.querybuilder.QueryBuilder`, the next question is how to get the results.
There are several ways to obtain data from a query:

.. code-block:: python

    qb = QueryBuilder()                 # Instantiating instance
    qb.append(CalcJobNode)              # Setting first vertices of path

    first_row = qb.first()              # Returns a list (!) of the results of the first row

    all_results_d = qb.dict()           # Returns all results as a list of dictionaries

    all_results_l = qb.all()            # Returns a list of lists

In case you are working with a large dataset, you can also return your query as a generator:

.. code-block:: python

    all_res_d_gen = qb.iterdict()       # Return a generator of dictionaries
                                        # of all results
    all_res_l_gen = qb.iterall()        # Returns a generator of lists

This will retrieve the data in batches, and you can start working with the data before the query has completely finished.
For example, you can iterate over the results of your query in a for loop:

.. code-block:: python

    for entry in qb.iterall():
        # do something with a single entry in the query result

.. _how-to:data:find:filters:

Filters
-------

Usually you do not want to query for *all* entities of a certain class, but rather *filter* the results based on certain properties.
Suppose you do not want all :class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.process.calculation.calcjob.CalcJobNode` data, but only those that are ``finished``:

.. code-block:: python

    qb = QueryBuilder()                 # Initialize a QueryBuilder instance
    qb.append(
        CalcJobNode,                    # Append a CalcJobNode
        filters={                       # Specify the filters:
            'attributes.process_state': 'finished',  # the process is finished
        },
    )

You can apply multiple filters to one entity in a query.
Say you are interested in all calculation jobs in your database that are ``finished`` **and** have ``exit_status == 0``:

.. code-block:: python

    qb = QueryBuilder()                 # Initialize a QueryBuilder instance
    qb.append(
        CalcJobNode,                    # Append a CalcJobNode
        filters={                       # Specify the filters:
            'attributes.process_state': 'finished',     # the process is finished AND
            'attributes.exit_status': 0                 # has exit_status == 0
        },
    )

In case you want to query for calculation jobs that satisfy one of these conditions, you can use the ``or`` operator:

.. code-block:: python

    qb = QueryBuilder()
    qb.append(
        CalcJobNode,
        filters={
            'or':[
                {'attributes.process_state': 'finished'},
                {'attributes.exit_status': 0}
            ]
        },
    )

If we had written ``and`` instead of ``or`` in the example above, we would have performed the exact same query as the previous one, because ``and`` is the default behavior if you provide several filters as key-value pairs in a dictionary to the ``filters`` argument.
In case you want all calculation jobs with state ``finished`` or ``excepted``, you can also use the ``in`` operator:

.. code-block:: python

    qb = QueryBuilder()
    qb.append(
        CalcJobNode,
        filters={
            'attributes.process_state': {'in': ['finished', 'excepted']}
        },
    )

You can negate a filter by adding an exclamation mark in front of the operator.
So, to query for all calculation jobs that are not a ``finished`` or ``excepted`` state:

.. code-block:: python

    qb = QueryBuilder()
    qb.append(
        CalcJobNode,
        filters={
            'attributes.process_state': {'!in': ['finished', 'excepted']}
        },
    )

.. note::

    The above rule applies to all operators.
    For example, you can check non-equality with ``!==``, since this is the equality operator (``==``) with a negation prepended.

A complete list of all available operators can be found in the :ref:`advanced querying section<topics:database:advancedquery:tables:operators>`.

.. _how-to:data:find:relationships:

Relationships
-------------

It is possible to query for data based on its relationship to another entity in the database.
Imagine you are not interested in the calculation jobs themselves, but in one of the outputs they create.
You can build upon your initial query for all  :class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.process.calculation.calcjob.CalcJobNode`'s in the database using the relationship of the output to the first step in the query:

.. code-block::

    qb = QueryBuilder()
    qb.append(CalcJobNode, tag='calcjob')
    qb.append(Int, with_incoming='calcjob')

In the first ``append`` call, we query for all  :class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.process.calculation.calcjob.CalcJobNode`'s in the database, and *tag* this step with the *unique* identifier ``'calcjob'``.
Next, we look for all ``Int`` nodes that are an output of the  :class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.process.calculation.calcjob.CalcJobNode`'s found in the first step, using the ``with_incoming`` relationship argument.
The ``Int`` node was created by the  :class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.process.calculation.calcjob.CalcJobNode` and as such has an *incoming* create link.

In the context of our query, we are building a *path* consisting of *vertices* (i.e. the entities we query for) connected by *edges* defined by the relationships between them.
The complete set of all possible relationships you can use query for, as well as the entities that they connect to, can be found in the :ref:`advanced querying section<topics:database:advancedquery:tables:relationships>`.

.. note::

    The ``tag`` identifier can be any alphanumeric string, it is simply a label used to refer to a previous vertex along the query path when defining a relationship.

.. _how-to:data:find:projections:

Projections
-----------

By default, the :class:`~aiida.orm.querybuilder.QueryBuilder` returns the instances of the entities corresponding to the final append to the query path.
For example:

.. code-block:: python

    qb = QueryBuilder()
    qb.append(CalcJobNode, tag='calcjob')
    qb.append(Int, with_incoming='calcjob')

The above code snippet will return all ``Int`` nodes that are outputs of any  :class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.process.calculation.calcjob.CalcJobNode`.
However, you can also *project* other entities in the path by adding ``project='*'`` to the corresponding ``append()`` call:

.. code-block:: python

    qb = QueryBuilder()
    qb.append(CalcJobNode, tag='calcjob', project='*')
    qb.append(Int, with_incoming='calcjob')

This will return all  :class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.process.calculation.calcjob.CalcJobNode`'s that have an ``Int`` output node.

However, in many cases we are not interested in the entities themselves, but rather their PK, UUID, *attributes* or some other piece of information stored by the entity.
This can be achieved by providing the corresponding *column* to the ``project`` keyword argument:

.. code-block:: python

    qb = QueryBuilder()
    qb.append(CalcJobNode, tag='calcjob')
    qb.append(Int, with_incoming='calcjob', project='id')

In the above example, executing the query returns all *PK's* of the ``Int`` nodes which are outputs of all  :class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.process.calculation.calcjob.CalcJobNode`'s in the database.
Moreover, you can project more than one piece of information for one vertex by providing a list:

.. code-block:: python

    qb = QueryBuilder()
    qb.append(CalcJobNode, tag='calcjob')
    qb.append(Int, with_incoming='calcjob', project=['id', 'attributes.value'])

For the query above, ``qb.all()`` will return a list of lists, for which each element corresponds to one entity and contains two items: the PK of the ``Int`` node and its value.
Finally, you can project information for multiple vertices along the query path:

.. code-block:: python

    qb = QueryBuilder()
    qb.append(CalcJobNode, tag='calcjob', project='*')
    qb.append(Int, with_incoming='calcjob', project=['id', 'attributes.value'])

All projections must start with one of the *columns* of the entities in the database, or project the instances themselves using ``'*'``.
Examples of columns we have encountered so far are ``id``, ``uuid`` and ``attributes``.
If the column is a dictionary, you can expand the dictionary values using a dot notation, as we have done in the previous example to obtain the ``attributes.value``.
This can be used to project the values of nested dictionaries as well.

.. note::

    Be aware that for consistency, ``QueryBuilder.all()`` / ``iterall()`` always returns a list of lists, even if you only project one property of a single entity.
    Use ``QueryBuilder.all(flat=True)`` to return the query result as a flat list in this case.

As mentioned in the beginning, this section provides only a brief introduction to the :class:`~aiida.orm.querybuilder.QueryBuilder`'s basic functionality.
To learn about more advanced queries, please see :ref:`the corresponding topics section<topics:database:advancedquery>`.


.. _how-to:data:organize:

Organizing data
===============

.. _how-to:data:organize:group:

How to group nodes
------------------

AiiDA's database is great for automatically storing all your data, but sometimes it can be tricky to navigate this flat data store.
To create some order in this mass of data, you can *group* sets of nodes together, just as you would with files in folders on your filesystem.
A folder, in this analogy, is represented by the :py:class:`~aiida.orm.groups.Group` class.
Each group instance can hold any amount of nodes and any node can be contained in any number of groups.
A typical use case is to store all nodes that share a common property in a single group.

Below we show how to perform a typical set of operations one may want to perform with groups.

Create a new group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From the command line interface:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi group create test_group

From the Python interface:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: group = Group(label='test_group')

    In [2]: group.store()
    Out[2]: <Group: "test_group" [type core], of user xxx@xx.com>


List available groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi group list

Groups come in different types, indicated by their type string.
By default ``verdi group list`` only shows groups of the type *core*.
In case you want to show groups of another type use ``-T/--type-string`` option.
If you want to show groups of all types, use the ``-a/--all-types`` option.

For example, to list groups of type ``core.auto``, use:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi group list -T core.auto

Similarly, we can use the ``type_string`` key to filter groups with the ``QueryBuilder``:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: QueryBuilder().append(Group, filters={'type_string': 'core'}).all(flat=True)
    Out[1]:
    [<Group: "another_group" [type core], of user xxx@xx.com>,
    <Group: "old_group" [type core], of user xxx@xx.com>,
    <Group: "new_group" [type core], of user xxx@xx.com>]

Add nodes to a group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Once the ``test_group`` has been created, we can add nodes to it.
For example, to add a node with ``pk=1`` to the group we could either use the command line interface:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi group add-nodes -G test_group 1
    Do you really want to add 1 nodes to Group<test_group>? [y/N]: y

Or the Python interface:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: group.add_nodes(load_node(pk=1))

Show information about a group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
From the command line interface:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi group show test_group

    -----------------  ----------------
    Group label        test_group
    Group type_string  user
    Group description  <no description>
    -----------------  ----------------
    # Nodes:
    PK    Type    Created
    ----  ------  ---------------
     1    Code    26D:21h:45m ago

Remove nodes from a group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
From the command line interface:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi group remove-nodes -G test_group 1
    Do you really want to remove 1 nodes from Group<test_group>? [y/N]: y

From the Python interface:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: group = load_group(label='test_group')

    In [2]: group.remove_nodes([load_node(1)])

Alternatively, you might want to remove *all* nodes from the group.
In the command line you just need to add ``-c/--clear`` option to ``verdi group remove-nodes ..``

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi group remove-nodes -c -G test_group
    Do you really want to remove ALL the nodes from Group<test_group>? [y/N]:

In the Python interface you can use ``.clear()`` method to achieve the same goal:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: group = load_group(label='test_group')

    In [2]: group.clear()


Rename a group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
From the command line interface:

.. code-block:: console

      $ verdi group relabel test_group old_group
      Success: Label changed to old_group

From the Python interface:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: group = load_group(label='old_group')

    In [2]: group.label = 'another_group'


Delete a group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
From the command line interface:

.. code-block:: console

      $ verdi group delete another_group
      Are you sure to delete Group<another_group>? [y/N]: y
      Success: Group<another_group> deleted.

Any deletion operation related to groups, by default, will not affect the nodes themselves.
For example if you delete a group, the nodes that belonged to the group will remain in the database.
The same happens if you remove nodes from the group -- they will remain in the database but won't belong to the group anymore.

If you also wish to delete the nodes, when deleting the group, use the ``--delete-nodes`` option:

.. code-block:: console

      $ verdi group delete another_group --delete-nodes

Copy one group into another
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This operation will copy the nodes of the source group into the destination group.
If the destination group does not yet exist, it will be created automatically.

From the command line interface:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi group copy source_group dest_group
    Success: Nodes copied from group<source_group> to group<dest_group>

From the Python interface:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: src_group = Group.objects.get(label='source_group')

    In [2]: dest_group = Group(label='destination_group').store()

    In [3]: dest_group.add_nodes(list(src_group.nodes))


Examples for using groups
-------------------------

In this section, we will provide some practical examples of how one can use Groups to structure and organize the nodes in the database.

.. _how-to:data:group-similar:

Group structures with a similar property
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Suppose, we wanted to group all structures for which the computed bandgap is higher than ``1.0 eV`` in a group named ``promising_structures``, one could use the following approach:

.. code-block:: python

    # Finding the structures with the bandgap > 1.0.
    qb = QueryBuilder()
    qb.append(StructureData,  tag='structure', project='*') # Here we are projecting the entire structure object
    qb.append(CalcJobNode, with_incoming='structure', tag='calculation')
    qb.append(Dict, with_incoming='calculation', filters={'attributes.bandgap': {'>': 1.0}})

    # Adding the structures in 'promising_structures' group.
    group = load_group(label='promising_structures')
    group.add_nodes(q.all(flat=True))

.. note::

    Any node can be included in a group only once and if it is added again, it is simply ignored.
    This means that add_nodes can be safely called multiple times, and only nodes that weren't already part of the group, will be added.


Use grouped data for further processing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here we demonstrate how to submit calculations for structures that all belong to a group named ``promising_structures``:

.. code-block:: python

    # Querying the structures that belong to the 'promising_structures' group.
    qb = QueryBuilder()
    qb.append(Group, filters={'label': 'promising_structures'}, tag='group')
    qb.append(StructureData, with_group='group')

    # Submitting the simulations.
    for structure in qb.all(flat=True):
        builder = SomeWorkChain.get_builder()
        builder.structure = structure
        ...
        submit(builder)

Note, however, that one can also use ``group.nodes`` to access the nodes of the group.
To achieve the same result as above one would need to do something as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    group = load_group(label='promising_structures')

    # Here make sure to include only structures, as group can contain any nodes.
    structures = [s for s in group.nodes if isinstance(nodes, StructureData)]
    for structure in structures:
        builder = SomeWorkChain.get_builder()
        builder.structure = structure
        ...
        submit(builder)


To find all structures that have a property ``property_a`` with a value lower than ``1`` and also belong to the ``promising_structures`` group, one could build a query as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    qb = QueryBuilder()
    qb.append(Group, filters={'label': 'promising_structures'}, tag='group')
    qb.append(StructureData, with_group='group', tag='structure', project='*')
    qb.append(SomeWorkChain, with_incoming='structure', tag='calculation')
    qb.append(Dict, with_incoming='calculation', filters={'attributes.property_a': {'<': 1}})

The return value of ``qb.all(flat=True)`` would contain all the structures matching the above mentioned criteria.

.. _how-to:data:organize:grouppath:

Organise groups in hierarchies
------------------------------

.. meta::
   :keywords: grouppath

Groups in AiiDA are inherently "flat", in that groups may only contain nodes and not other groups.
However it is possible to construct *virtual* group hierarchies based on delimited group labels, using the :py:class:`~aiida.tools.groups.paths.GroupPath` utility.

:py:class:`~aiida.tools.groups.paths.GroupPath` is designed to work in much the same way as Python's :py:class:`pathlib.Path`, whereby paths are denoted by forward slash characters '/' in group labels.

For example say we have the groups:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi group list

    PK    Label                    Type string    User
    ----  -----------------        -------------  --------------
    1     base1/sub_group1         core           user@email.com
    2     base1/sub_group2         core           user@email.com
    3     base2/other/sub_group3   core           user@email.com

We can also access them from the command-line as:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi group path ls -l
    Path         Sub-Groups
    ---------  ------------
    base1                 2
    base2                 1
    $ verdi group path ls base1
    base1/sub_group1
    base1/sub_group2

Or from the python interface:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: from aiida.tools.groups import GroupPath
    In [2]: path = GroupPath("base1")
    In [3]: print(list(path.children))
    Out[3]: [GroupPath('base1/sub_group2', cls='<class 'aiida.orm.groups.Group'>'),
             GroupPath('base1/sub_group1', cls='<class 'aiida.orm.groups.Group'>')]

The ``GroupPath`` can be constructed using indexing or "divisors":

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [4]: path = GroupPath()
    In [5]: path["base1"] == path / "base1"
    Out[5]: True

Using the :py:func:`~aiida.tools.groups.paths.GroupPath.browse` attribute, you can also construct the paths as preceding attributes.
This is useful in interactive environments, whereby available paths will be shown in the tab-completion:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [6]: path.browse.base1.sub_group2()
    Out[6]: GroupPath('base1/sub_group2', cls='<class 'aiida.orm.groups.Group'>')

To check the existence of a path element:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [7]: "base1" in path
    Out[7]: True

A group may be "virtual", in which case its label does not directly relate to a group, or the group can be retrieved with the :py:func:`~aiida.tools.groups.paths.GroupPath.get_group` method:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [8]: path.is_virtual
    Out[8]: True
    In [9]: path.get_group() is None
    Out[9]: True
    In [10]: path["base1/sub_group1"].is_virtual
    Out[10]: False
    In [11]: path["base1/sub_group1"].get_group()
    Out[11]: <Group: "base1/sub_group1" [type core], of user user@email.com>

Groups can be created and destroyed:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [12]: path["base1/sub_group1"].delete_group()
    In [13]: path["base1/sub_group1"].is_virtual
    Out[13]: True
    In [14]: path["base1/sub_group1"].get_or_create_group()
    Out[14]: (<Group: "base1/sub_group1" [type core], of user user@email.com>, True)
    In [15]: path["base1/sub_group1"].is_virtual
    Out[15]: False

To traverse paths, use the :py:func:`~aiida.tools.groups.paths.GroupPath.children` attribute - for recursive traversal, use :py:func:`~aiida.tools.groups.paths.GroupPath.walk`:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [16]: for subpath in path.walk(return_virtual=False):
        ...:     print(subpath)
        ...:
    GroupPath('base1/sub_group1', cls='<class 'aiida.orm.groups.Group'>')
    GroupPath('base1/sub_group2', cls='<class 'aiida.orm.groups.Group'>')
    GroupPath('base2/other/sub_group3', cls='<class 'aiida.orm.groups.Group'>')

You can also traverse directly through the nodes of a path, optionally filtering by node class and any other filters allowed by the :ref:`QueryBuilder <how-to:data:find>`:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [17]: from aiida.orm import Data
    In [18]: data = Data()
    In [19]: data.set_extra("key", "value")
    In [20]: data.store()
    Out[20]: <Data: uuid: 0adb5224-585d-4fd4-99ae-20a071972ddd (pk: 1)>
    In [21]: path["base1/sub_group1"].get_group().add_nodes(data)
    In [21]: next(path.walk_nodes(node_class=Data, filters={"extras.key": "value"}))
    Out[21]: WalkNodeResult(group_path=GroupPath('base1/sub_group1', cls='<class 'aiida.orm.groups.Group'>'),
    node=<Data: uuid: 0adb5224-585d-4fd4-99ae-20a071972ddd (pk: 1)>)

Finally, you can also specify the ``Group`` subclasses (as discussed above):

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [22]: from aiida.orm import UpfFamily
    In [23]: path2 = GroupPath(cls=UpfFamily)
    In [24]: path2["base1"].get_or_create_group()
    Out[24]: (<UpfFamily: "base1" [type core.upf], of user user@email.com>, True)

.. important::

    A :py:class:`~aiida.tools.groups.paths.GroupPath` instance will only recognise groups of the instantiated ``cls`` type.
    The default ``cls`` is ``aiida.orm.Group``:

    .. code-block:: ipython

        In [25]: orm.UpfFamily(label="a").store()
        Out[25]: <UpfFamily: "a" [type core.upf], of user user@email.com>
        In [26]: GroupPath("a").is_virtual
        Out[26]: True
        In [27]: GroupPath("a", cls=orm.UpfFamily).is_virtual
        Out[27]: False


.. _how-to:data:delete:

Deleting data
=============

By default, every time you run or submit a new calculation, AiiDA will create for you new nodes in the database, and will never replace or delete data.
There are cases, however, when it might be useful to delete nodes that are not useful anymore, for instance test runs or incorrect/wrong data and calculations.
For this case, AiiDA provides the ``verdi node delete`` command and the :py:func:`~aiida.tools.graph.deletions.delete_nodes` function, to remove the nodes from the provenance graph.

.. caution::
   Once the data is deleted, there is no way to recover it (unless you made a backup).

Critically, note that even if you ask to delete only one node, ``verdi node delete`` will typically delete a number of additional linked nodes, in order to preserve a consistent state of the provenance graph.
For instance, if you delete an input of a calculation, AiiDA will delete also the calculation itself (as otherwise you would be effectively changing the inputs to that calculation in the provenance graph).
The full set of consistency rules are explained in detail :ref:`here <topics:provenance:consistency>`.

Therefore: always check the output of ``verdi node delete`` to make sure that it is not deleting more than you expect.
You can also use the ``--dry-run`` flag of ``verdi node delete`` to see what the command would do without performing any actual operation.

In addition, there are a number of additional rules that are not mandatory to ensure consistency, but can be toggled by the user.
For instance, you can set ``--create-forward`` if, when deleting a calculation, you want to delete also the data it produced (using instead ``--no-create-forward`` will delete the calculation only, keeping the output data: note that this effectively strips out the provenance information of the output data).
The full list of these flags is available from the help command ``verdi node delete -h``.

.. code-block:: python

    from aiida.tools import delete_nodes
    pks_to_be_deleted = delete_nodes(
        [1, 2, 3], dry_run=True, create_forward=True, call_calc_forward=True, call_work_forward=True
    )

Deleting computers
------------------
To delete a computer, you can use ``verdi computer delete``.
This command is mostly useful if, right after creating a computer, you realise that there was an error and you want to remove it.
In particular, note that ``verdi computer delete`` will prevent execution if the computer has been already used by at least one node. In this case, you will need to use ``verdi node delete`` to delete first the corresponding nodes.

Deleting mutable data
---------------------
A subset of data in AiiDA is mutable also after storing a node, and is used as a convenience for the user to tag/group/comment on data.
This data can be safely deleted at any time.
This includes, notably:

* *Node extras*: These can be deleted using :py:meth:`~aiida.orm.entities.EntityExtrasMixin.delete_extra` and :py:meth:`~aiida.orm.entities.EntityExtrasMixin.delete_extra_many` methods.
* *Node comments*: These can be removed using :py:meth:`~aiida.orm.nodes.node.Node.remove_comment`.
* *Groups*: These can be deleted using :py:meth:`Group.objects.delete() <aiida.orm.groups.Group.Collection.delete>`.
  This command will only delete the group, not the nodes contained in the group.

Completely deleting an AiiDA profile
------------------------------------
If you don't want to selectively delete some nodes, but instead want to delete a whole AiiDA profile altogether, use the ``verdi profile delete`` command.
This command will delete both the file repository and the database.

.. danger::

  It is not possible to restore a deleted profile unless it was previously backed up!

.. _how-to:data:transfer:

Transferring data
=================

.. versionadded:: 1.6.0

.. danger::

    This feature is still in beta version and its API might change in the near future.
    It is therefore not recommended that you rely on it for your public/production workflows.

    Moreover, feedback on its implementation is much appreciated (at https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/issues/4811).

When a calculation job is launched, AiiDA will create a :py:class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.data.remote.RemoteData` node that is attached as an output node to the calculation node with the label ``remote_folder``.
The input files generated by the ``CalcJob`` plugin are copied to this remote folder and, since the job is executed there as well, the code will produce its output files in that same remote folder also.
Since the :py:class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.data.remote.RemoteData` node only explicitly stores the filepath on the remote computer, and not its actual contents, it functions more or less like a symbolic link.
That means that if the remote folder gets deleted, there will be no way to retrieve its contents.
The ``CalcJob`` plugin can for that reason specify some files that should be :ref:`retrieved<topics:calculations:usage:calcjobs:file_lists_retrieve>` and stored locally in a :py:class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.data.folder.FolderData` node for safekeeing, which is attached to the calculation node as an output with the label ``retrieved_folder``.

Although the :ref:`retrieve_list<topics:calculations:usage:calcjobs:file_lists_retrieve>` allows to specify what output files are to be retrieved locally, this has to be done *before* the calculation is submitted.
In order to provide more flexibility in deciding what files of completed calculation jobs are to be stored locally, even after it has terminated, AiiDA ships with a the :py:class:`~aiida.calculations.transfer.TransferCalculation` plugin.
This calculation plugin enables to retrieve files from a remote machine and save them in a local :py:class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.data.folder.FolderData`.
The specifications of what to copy are provided through an input of type

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: instructions_cont = {}
        ... instructions_cont['retrieve_files'] = True
        ... instructions_cont['symlink_files'] = [
        ...     ('node_keyname', 'source/path/filename', 'target/path/filename'),
        ... ]
        ... instructions_node = orm.Dict(dict=instructions_cont)

The ``'source/path/filename'`` and ``'target/path/filename'`` are both relative paths (to their respective folders).
The ``node_keyname`` is a string that will be used when providing the source :py:class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.data.remote.RemoteData` node to the calculation.
You also need to provide the computer between which the transfer will occur:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [2]: transfer_builder = CalculationFactory('core.transfer').get_builder()
        ... transfer_builder.instructions = instructions_node
        ... transfer_builder.source_nodes = {'node_keyname': source_node}
        ... transfer_builder.metadata.computer = source_node.computer

The variable ``source_node`` here corresponds to the ``RemoteData`` node whose contents need to be retrieved.
Finally, you just run or submit the calculation as you would do with any other:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [2]: from aiida.engine import submit
        ... submit(transfer_builder)

You can also use this to copy local files into a new :py:class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.data.remote.RemoteData` folder.
For this you first have to adapt the instructions to set ``'retrieve_files'`` to ``False`` and use a ``'local_files'`` list instead of the ``'symlink_files'``:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: instructions_cont = {}
        ... instructions_cont['retrieve_files'] = False
        ... instructions_cont['local_files'] = [
        ...     ('node_keyname', 'source/path/filename', 'target/path/filename'),
        ... ]
        ... instructions_node = orm.Dict(dict=instructions_cont)

It is also relevant to note that, in this case, the ``source_node`` will be of type :py:class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.data.folder.FolderData` so you will have to manually select the computer to where you want to copy the files.
You can do this by looking at your available computers running ``verdi computer list`` and using the label shown to load it with :py:func:`~aiida.orm.utils.load_computer`:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [2]: transfer_builder.metadata.computer = load_computer('some-computer-label')

Both when uploading or retrieving, you can copy multiple files by appending them to the list of the ``local_files`` or ``symlink_files`` keys in the instructions input, respectively.
It is also possible to copy files from any number of nodes by providing several ``source_node`` s, each with a different ``'node_keyname'``.
The target node will always be one (so you can *"gather"* files in a single call, but not *"distribute"* them).

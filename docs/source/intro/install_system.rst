************************
System-wide installation
************************

The system-wide installation will install the prerequisite services (PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ) via standard package managers such that their startup and shut-down is largely managed by the operating system.
The AiiDA (core) Python package is then installed either with Conda or pip.

This is the *recommended* installation method to setup AiiDA on a personal laptop or workstation for the majority of users.

   **Install prerequisite services**

      AiiDA is designed to run on `Unix <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix>`_ operating systems and requires a `bash <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)>`_ or `zsh <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell>`_ shell, and Python >= 3.7.

   .. tabbed:: Ubuntu

      *AiiDA is tested on Ubuntu versions 16.04, 18.04, and 20.04.*

      Open a terminal and execute:

       .. code-block:: console

           $ sudo apt install \
              git python3-dev python3-pip \
              postgresql postgresql-server-dev-all postgresql-client rabbitmq-server

   .. tabbed:: MacOS X (Homebrew)

       The recommended installation method for Mac OS X is to use `Homebrew <https://brew.sh>`__.

       #. Follow `this guide <https://docs.brew.sh/Installation>`__ to install Homebrew on your system if not installed yet.

       #. Open a terminal and execute:

          .. code-block:: console

              $ brew install postgresql rabbitmq git python
              $ brew services start postgresql
              $ brew services start rabbitmq

   .. tabbed:: Windows Subsystem for Linux

      *The following instructions are for setting up AiiDA on WSL 1/2 in combination with Ubuntu.*

      #. Installing RabbitMQ:

         * (WSL 1) Install and start the `Windows native RabbitMQ <https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-windows.html>`_.

         * (WSL 2) Install RabbitMQ inside the the WSL:

            .. code-block:: console

                $ sudo apt install rabbitmq-server
                $ sudo service rabbitmq-server start

      #. Install Python and PostgreSQL:

         .. code-block:: console

             $ sudo apt install \
                postgresql postgresql-server-dev-all postgresql-client \
                git python3-dev python-pip
             $ sudo service postgresql start

      .. dropdown:: How to setup WSL to automatically start services after system boot.

          Create a file ``start_aiida_services.sh`` containing the following lines:

          .. code-block:: console

             service postgresql start
             service rabbitmq-server start # Only for WSL 2!

          and store it in your preferred location, e.g., the home directory.
          Then make the file executeable, and editable only by root users with:

          .. code-block:: console

             $ chmod a+x,go-w /path/to/start_aiida_services.sh
             $ sudo chown root:root /path/to/start_aiida_services.sh

          Next, run

          .. code-block:: console

             $ sudo visudo

          and add the line

          .. code-block:: sh

             <username> ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /path/to/start_aiida_services.sh

          replacing ``<username>`` with your Ubuntu username.
          This will allow you to run *only* this specific ``.sh`` file with ``root`` access (without password), without lowering security on the rest of your system.

          Now you can use the Windows Task Scheduler to automatically execute this file on startup:

          #. Open Task Scheduler.

          #. In the "Actions" menu, click "Create Task".

          #. In "General/Security options", select "Run whether user is logged on or not".

          #. In the "Triggers" tab, click "New...".

             #. In the "Begin the task:" dropdown, select "At startup".

             #. Click "OK" to confirm.

          #. In the "Actions" tab, click "New...".

             #. In the "Action" dropdown, select "Start a program".

             #. In the "Program/script" text field, add ``C:\Windows\System32\bash.exe``.

             #. In the "Add arguments (optional)" text field, add ``-c "sudo /path/to/start_aiida_services.sh"``.

             #. Click "OK" to confirm.

          #. Click "OK" to confirm the task.

          You can tweak other details of this task to fit your needs.

   .. tabbed:: Other

      #. Install RabbitMQ following the `instructions applicable to your system <https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html>`__.
      #. Install PostgreSQL following the `instructions applicable to your system <https://www.postgresql.org/download/>`__.

      .. tip::

          Alternatively use the :ref:`pure conda installation method <intro:get_started:conda-install>`.

   **Install AiiDA (core)**

   .. tabbed:: pip + venv

      *Install the aiida-core package from PyPI into a virtual environment.*

      Open a terminal and execute:

      .. code-block:: console

          $ python -m pip venv ~/envs/aiida
          $ source ~/envs/aiida/bin/activate
          (aiida) $ pip install aiida-core
          (aiida) $ reentry scan

      .. tip::

          See the `venv documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`__ if the activation command fails.
          The exact command for activating a virtual environment differs slightly based on the used shell.

      .. dropdown:: :fa:`plus-circle` Installation extras

         There are additional optional packages that you may want to install, which are grouped in the following categories:

         * ``atomic_tools``: packages that allow importing and manipulating crystal structure from various formats
         * ``ssh_kerberos``: adds support for ssh transport authentication through Kerberos
         * ``REST``: allows a REST server to be ran locally to serve AiiDA data
         * ``docs``: tools to build the documentation
         * ``notebook``: jupyter notebook - to allow it to import AiiDA modules
         * ``tests``: python modules required to run the automatic unit tests
         * ``pre-commit``: pre-commit tools required for developers to enable automatic code linting and formatting

         In order to install any of these package groups, simply append them as a comma separated list in the ``pip`` install command, for example:

         .. code-block:: console

             (aiida) $ pip install aiida-core[atomic_tools,docs]

         .. dropdown:: :fa:`wrench` Kerberos on Ubuntu

            If you are installing the optional ``ssh_kerberos`` and you are on Ubuntu you might encounter an error related to the ``gss`` package.
            To fix this you need to install the ``libffi-dev`` and ``libkrb5-dev`` packages:

            .. code-block:: console

               $ sudo apt-get install libffi-dev libkrb5-dev

   .. tabbed:: Conda

      *Install the aiida-core package in a Conda environment.*

      #. Make sure that conda is installed, e.g., by following `the instructions on installing Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`__.

      #. Open a terminal and execute:

         .. code-block:: console

             $ conda create -n aiida -c conda-forge aiida-core
             $ conda activate aiida
             (aiida) $ reentry scan

   .. tabbed:: From source

      *Install the aiida-core package directly from the cloned repository.*

      Open a terminal and execute:

      .. code-block:: console

          $ git clone https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core.git
          $ cd aiida-core/
          $ python -m pip venv ~/envs/aiida
          $ source ~/envs/aiida/bin/activate
          (aiida) $ pip install .
          (aiida) $ reentry scan

   **Setup profile**

   Next, set up an AiiDA configuration profile and related data storage, with the ``verdi quicksetup`` command.

   .. code-block:: console

       (aiida) $ verdi quicksetup
       Info: enter "?" for help
       Info: enter "!" to ignore the default and set no value
       Profile name: me
       Email Address (for sharing data): me@user.com
       First name: my
       Last name: name
       Institution: where-i-work

   ---

   **Start verdi daemons**

   Start the verdi daemon(s) that are used to run AiiDA workflows.

   .. code-block:: console

       (aiida) $ verdi daemon start 2

   .. important::

        The verdi daemon(s) must be restarted after a system reboot.

   .. tip::

       Do not start more daemons then there are physical processors on your system.

   ---

   **Check setup**

   To check that everything is set up correctly, execute:

   .. code-block:: console

       (aiida) $ verdi status
       ✓ config dir:  /home/ubuntu/.aiida
       ✓ profile:     On profile me
       ✓ repository:  /home/ubuntu/.aiida/repository/me
       ✓ postgres:    Connected as aiida_qs_ubuntu_c6a4f69d255fbe9cdb7385dcdcf3c050@localhost:5432
       ✓ rabbitmq:    Connected as amqp://127.0.0.1?heartbeat=600
       ✓ daemon:      Daemon is running as PID 16430 since 2020-04-29 12:17:31

   At this point you should now have a working AiiDA environment, from which you can add and retrieve data.

# Configuration for readthedocs

# Important: we need to disable all unneeded formats. 
# Note that HTML and JSON are always built: 
# https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/yaml-config.html#formats 
# Especially, the 'htmlzip' format takes a LOT of memory and causes
# the build to fail - see our issue #1472:
# https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida_core/issues/1472
formats: []

## For now I don't specify any other parameter, that is 
## currently setup in the web page of Read the Docs.
## For other parameters see
## https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/yaml-config.html

There are a number of additional tutorials you might want to follow. These are typically included in the documentation
of each plugin. Below we mention a few notable examples, but feel free to check the documentation of your favourite
plugin (and don't hesitate to ask the developer to write a tutorial, if there isn't any!)

Quantum ESPRESSO tutorials
--------------------------
The AiiDA plugins for Quantum ESPRESSO provide a set of tutorials for some of the
main Quantum ESPRESSO codes (PW, PH, CP, and one of the post-processing tools PROJWFC).
You can find them on the `plugin documentation page <http://aiida-quantumespresso.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/get_started/index.html>`_.

Updating AiiDA
**************

Before you update your AiiDA installation, please:

* Enter the python environment where AiiDA is installed
* Stop your daemon by executing ``verdi daemon stop``
* Create a backup of your database(s) by following the guidelines in the :ref:`backup section<backup>`
* Create a backup of the ``~/.aiida`` folder (where configuration files are stored)

If you have installed AiiDA through ``pip`` run::

  pip install --upgrade aiida-core

If you have installed AiiDA from a local clone of the ``aiida_core``
repository, enter the directory of the local clone and run::

  find . -name "*.pyc" -type f -delete  # deletes pre-compiled python files
  git checkout <desired-branch>
  git pull
  pip install -e .
  
After upgrading AiiDA, you may need to migrate your AiiDA database to the latest 
version of the schema.
If migrations are required, running any ``verdi`` command will automatically raise an exception
and print the instructions for performing the :ref:`migrations <update_migrations>`.

.. code-block:: bash

    aiida.common.exceptions.ConfigurationError: Database schema version 1.0.19 is outdated compared to the code schema version 1.0.20
    To migrate the database to the current version, run the following commands:
      verdi -p quicksetup daemon stop
      verdi -p quicksetup database migrate

Once the migrations have been performed, start the daemon and you are done.

.. note::

    Each version increase may come with its own necessary migrations and you should
    only ever update the version by one at a time.  
    Therefore, first get the version number from ``verdi --version``

  SQLAlchemy backend. In case you were using SQLAlchemy before the introduction
  of Alembic, you may experience problems during your first migration. If it is
  the case, please see :ref:`this section <first_alembic_migration>`.

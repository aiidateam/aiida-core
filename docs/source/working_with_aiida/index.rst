======================
Command line interface
======================

The main way of interacting with AiiDA is through a command line interface tool called ``verdi``.
Below you will find an overview of all the commands that are available with a link to a more detailed explanation of their usage and available parameters.
But before you dive in, take a few minutes to read the :ref:`general concepts<cli_concepts>` that apply to the entire interface of ``verdi``.
This will make understanding and using ``verdi`` a lot easier!

Scripting
=========

While many common functionalities are provided by either command-line tools
(via ``verdi``) or the web interface, for fine tuning (or automatization)
it is useful to directly access the python objects and call their methods.
This is possible in two ways, either via an interactive shell, or writing and
running a script. Both methods are described below.

==========
Schedulers
==========

As described in the section about calculations, ``CalcJobNode`` instances are submitted by the daemon to an external scheduler.
For this functionality to work, AiiDA needs to be able to interact with these schedulers.
Interfaces have been written for some of the most used schedulers.

    """Data plugin that allows to easily wrap objects that are JSON-able.

    Any class that implements the ``as_dict`` method, returning a dictionary that is a JSON serializable representation
    of the object, can be wrapped and stored by this data plugin.

    As an example, take the ``Molecule`` class of the ``pymatgen`` library, which respects the spec described above. To
    store an instance as a ``JsonableData`` simply pass an instance as an argument to the constructor as follows::

        from pymatgen.core import Molecule
        molecule = Molecule(['H']. [0, 0, 0])
        node = JsonableData(molecule)
        node.store()

    Since ``Molecule.as_dict`` returns a dictionary that is JSON-serializable, the data plugin will call it and store
    the dictionary as the attributes of the ``JsonableData`` node in the database.

    .. note:: A JSON-serializable dictionary means a dictionary that when passed to ``json.dumps`` does not except but
        produces a valid JSON string representation of the dictionary.

    If the wrapped class implements a class-method ``from_dict``, the wrapped instance can easily be recovered from a
    previously stored node that was optionally loaded from the database. The ``from_dict`` method should simply accept
    a single argument which is the dictionary that is returned by the ``as_dict`` method. If this criteria is satisfied,
    an instance wrapped and stored in a ``JsonableData`` node can be recovered through the ``obj`` property::

        loaded = load_node(node.pk)
        molecule = loaded.obj

    Of course, this requires that the class of the originally wrapped instance can be imported in the current
    environment, or an ``ImportError`` will be raised.

        # work around this asymmetry, we perform a serialization round-trip with the ``JsonEncoder`` and ``JsonDecoder``

        # placeholders are kept. This now ensures that the full dictionary will be serializable by PostgreSQL.

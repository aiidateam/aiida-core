## v2.5.0 - 2023-12-20

This minor release comes with a number of features that are focused on user friendliness of the CLI and the API.
It also reduces the import time of modules, which makes the CLI faster to load and so tab-completion should be snappier.
The release adds support for Python 3.12 and a great number of bugs are fixed.

### Create profiles without a database server

A new storage backend plugin has been added that uses [`SQLite`](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) instead of PostgreSQL.
This makes it a lot easier to setup across all platforms.
A new profile using this storage backend can be created in a single command:
```shell
verdi profile setup core.sqlite_dos -n --profile <PROFILE_NAME> --email <EMAIL>
```
Although easier to setup compared to the default storage backend that uses PostgreSQL, it is less performant.
This makes this storage ideally suited for use-cases that want to test or demonstrate AiiDA, or to just play around a bit.
The storage is compatible with most of AiiDA's functionality, except for automated database migrations and some very specific `QueryBuilder` functionality.
Therefore, for production databases, the default `core.psql_dos` storage entry point remains the recommended storage.

It is now also possible to create a profile using an export archive:
```shell
verdi profile setup core.sqlite_dos -n --profile <PROFILE_NAME> --filepath <ARCHIVE>
```
where `<ARCHIVE>` should point to an export archive on disk.
You can now use this profile like any other profile to inspect the data of the export archive.
Note that this profile is read-only, so you will not be able to use it to mutate existing data or add new data to the profile.
See the [documentation for more details and a more in-depth example](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/v2.5.0/howto/archive_profile.html).

Finally, the original storage plugin `core.psql_dos`, which uses PostgreSQL for the database is also accessible through `verdi profile setup core.psql_dos`.
Essentially this is the same as the `verdi setup` command, which is kept for now for backwards compatibility.

See the [documentation on storage plugins](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/v2.5.0/topics/storage.html) for more details on the differences between these storage plugins and when to use which.

The `verdi profile delete` command can now also be used to delete a profile for any of these storage plugins.
You will be prompted whether you also want to delete all the data, or you can specify this with the `--delete-data` or `--keep-data` flags.

### Changes in process launch functions

The `aiida.engine.submit` method now accepts the argument `wait`.
When set to `True`, instead of returning the process node straight away, the function will wait for the process to terminate before returning.
By default it is set to `False` so the current behavior remains unchanged.
```python
from aiida.engine import submit
node = submit(Process, wait=True)  # This call will block until process is terminated
assert node.is_terminated
```

This new feature is mostly useful for interactive demos and tutorials in notebooks.
In these situations, it might be beneficial to use `aiida.engine.run` because the cell will be blocking until it is finished, indicating to the user that something is processing.
When using `submit`, the cell returns immediately, but the results are not ready yet and typically the next cell cannot yet be executed.
Instead, the demo should redirect the user to using something like `verdi process list` to query the status of the process.

However, using `run` has downsides as well, most notably that the process will be lost if the notebook gets disconnected.
For processes that are expected to run longer, this can be really problematic, and so `submit` will have to be used regardless.
With the new `wait` argument, `submit` provides the best of both worlds.

Although very useful, the introduction of this feature does break any processes that define `wait` or `wait_interval` as an input.
Since the inputs to a process are defined as keyword arguments, these inputs would overlap with the arguments to the `submit` method.
To solve this problem, inputs can now _also_ be passed as a dictionary, e.g., where one would do before:
```python
submit(SomeProcess, x=Int(1), y=Int(2), code=load_code('some-code'))
# or alternatively
inputs = {
    'x': Int(1),
    'y': Int(2),
    'code': load_code('some-code'),
}
submit(SomeProcess, **inputs)
```
The new syntax allows the following:
```python
inputs = {
    'x': Int(1),
    'y': Int(2),
    'code': load_code('some-code'),
}
submit(SomeProcess, inputs)
```
Passing inputs as keyword arguments is still supported because sometimes that notation is still more legible than defining an intermediate dictionary.
However, if both an input dictionary and keyword arguments are define, an exception is raised.

### Improvements for built-in data types

The `XyData` and `ArrayData` data plugins now allow to directly pass the content in the constructor.
This allows defining the complete node in a single line
```python
import numpy as np
from aiida.orm import ArrayData, XyData

xy = XyData(np.array([1, 2]), np.array([3, 4]), x_name='x', x_units='E', y_names='y', y_units='F')
assert all(xy.get_x()[1] == np.array([1, 2]))

array = ArrayData({'a': np.array([1, 2]), 'b': np.array([3, 4])})
assert all(array.get_array('a') == np.array([1, 2]))
```
It is now also no longer required to specify the name in `ArrayData.get_array` as long as the node contains just a single array:
```python
import numpy as np
from aiida.orm import ArrayData

array = ArrayData(np.array([1, 2]))
assert all(array.get_array() == np.array([1, 2]))
```

### Repository interface improvements

As of `v2.0.0`, the repository interface of the `Node` class was moved to the `Node.base.repository` namespace.
This was done to clean up the top-level namespace of the `Node` class which was getting very crowded, and in most use-cases, a user never needs to directly access these methods.
It is up to the data plugin to provide specific methods to retrieve data that might be stored in the repository.
For example, with the `ArrayData`, a user should now have to go to `ArrayData.base.repository.get_object_content` to retrieve an array from the repository, but the class provides `ArrayData.get_array` as a shortcut.

A few data plugins that ship with `aiida-core` didn't respect this guideline, most notably the `FolderData` and `SinglefileData` plugins.
This has been corrected in this release: for `FolderData`, all the repository methods are now once again directly available on the top-level namespace.
The `SinglefileData` now makes it easier to get the content as bytes.
Before, one had to do:
```python
from aiida.orm import SinglefileData
node = SinglefileData.from_string('some content')
with node.open(mode='rb') as handle:
    byte_content = handle.read()
```
this can now be achieved with:
```python
from aiida.orm import SinglefileData
node = SinglefileData.from_string('some content')
byte_content = node.get_content(mode='rb')
```

As of v2.0, due to the repository redesign, it was no longer possible to access a file directly by a filepath on disk.
The repository interface only interacts with file-like objects to stream the content.
However, a lot of Python libraries expect filepaths on disk and do not support file-like objects.
This would force an AiiDA user to write the file from the repository to a temporary file on disk, and pass that temporary filepath.
For example, consider the `numpy.loadtxt` function which requires a filepath, the code would look something like:
```python
import pathlib
import shutil
import tempfile

with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp_path:

    # Copy the entire content to the temporary folder
    dirpath = pathlib.Path(tmp_path)
    node.base.repository.copy_tree(dirpath)

    # Or copy the content of a file. Should use streaming
    # to avoid reading everything into memory
    filepath = (dirpath / 'some_file.txt')
    with filepath.open('rb') as target:
        with node.base.repository.open('rb') as source:
            shutil.copyfileobj(source, target)

    # Now use `filepath` to library call, e.g.
    numpy.loadtxt(filepath)
```
This burdensome boilerplate has now been made obsolete by the `as_path` method:
```python
with node.base.repository.as_path() as filepath:
    numpy.loadtxt(filepath)
```
For the `FolderData` and `SinglefileData` plugins, the method can be accessed on the top-level namespace of course.

## v2.4.0 - 2023-06-22

This minor release comes with a number of new features and improvements as well as a significant amount of bug fixes.
Support for Python 3.8 has been officially dropped in accordance with [AEP 003](https://github.com/aiidateam/AEP/blob/master/003_adopt_nep_29/readme.md).

As a result of one of the bug fixes, related to the [caching of `CalcJob` nodes](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/commit/685e0f87d7c571df24aea8f0ce21c6c45dfbd8a0), a database migration had to be added, the first since the release of v2.0.
After ugrading to v2.4.0, you will be prompted to migrate your database.
The automated migration drops the hashes of existing `CalcJobNode`s and provides you with the optional command to recompute them.
Execute the command if existing `CalcJobNode`s need to be usable as valid cache sources.

### Process function improvements
A number of improvements in the usage of process functions, i.e., `calcfunction` and `workfunction`, have been added.
Each subsection title is a link to the documentation for more details.

#### [Variadic arguments](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/latest/topics/processes/functions.html#variadic-and-keyword-arguments)
Variadic arguments can be used in case the function should accept a list of inputs of unknown length.
Consider the example of a calculation function that computes the average of a number of `Int` nodes:
```python
@calcfunction
def average(*args):
    return sum(args) / len(args)

result = average(*(1, 2, 3))
```

#### [Automatic type validation](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/latest/topics/processes/functions.html#type-validation)
Type hint annotations can now be used to add automatic type validation to process functions.
```python
@calcfunction
def add(x: Int, y: Int):
    return x + y

add(1, 1.0)  # Passes
add(1, '1.0')  # Raises an exception
```
Since the Python base types (`int`, `str`, `bool`, etc.) are automatically serialized, these can also be used in type hints.
The following example is therefore identical to the previous:
```python
@calcfunction
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```

#### [Docstring parsing](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/latest/topics/processes/functions.html#docstring-parsing)
The `calcfunction` and `workfunction` generate a `Process` of the decorated function on-the-fly.
In doing so, it automatically defines the `ProcessSpec` that is normally done manually, such as for a `CalcJob` or a `WorkChain`.
Before, this would just define the ports that the function process accepts, but the `help` attribute of the port would be left empty.
This is now parsed from the docstring, if it can be correctly parsed:
```python
@calcfunction
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """Add two integers.

    :param x: Left hand operand.
    :param y: Right hand operand.
    """
    return x + y

assert add.spec().inputs['a'].help == 'Left hand operand.'
assert add.spec().inputs['b'].help == 'Right hand operand.'
```
This functionality is particularly useful when exposing process functions in work chains.
Since the process specification of the exposed function will be automatically inherited, the user can inspect the `help` string through the builder.
The automatic documentation produced by the Sphinx plugin will now also display the help string parsed from the docstring.

#### [Nested labels for output nodes](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/latest/topics/processes/functions.html#return-values)
The keys in the output dictionary can now contain nested namespaces:
```python
@calcfunction
def add(alpha, beta):
    return {'nested.sum': alpha + beta}

result = add(Int(1), Int(2))
assert result['nested']['sum'] == 3
```

#### [As class member methods](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/latest/topics/processes/functions.html#as-class-member-methods)
Process functions can now be defined as class member methods of work chains:
```python
class CalcFunctionWorkChain(WorkChain):

    @classmethod
    def define(cls, spec):
        super().define(spec)
        spec.input('x')
        spec.input('y')
        spec.output('sum')
        spec.outline(
            cls.run_compute_sum,
        )

    @staticmethod
    @calcfunction
    def compute_sum(x, y):
        return x + y

    def run_compute_sum(self):
        self.out('sum', self.compute_sum(self.inputs.x, self.inputs.y))
```
The function should be declared as a `staticmethod` and it should not include the `self` argument in its function signature.
It can then be called from within the work chain as `self.function_name(*args, **kwargs)`.


### Scheduler plugins: including `environment_variables`
The `Scheduler` base class implements the concrete method `_get_submit_script_environment_variables` which formats the lines for the submission script that set the environment variables that were defined in the `metadata.options.environment_variables` input.
Before it was left up to the plugins to actually call this method in the `_get_submit_script_header`, but this is now done by the base class in the `get_submit_script`.
You can now remove the call to `_get_submit_script_environment_variables` from your scheduler plugins, as the base class will take care of it.
A deprecation warning is emitted if the base class detects that the plugin is still calling it manually.
See the [pull request](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/5948) for more details.

### `WorkChain`: conditional predicates should return boolean-like
Up till now, work chain methods that are used as the predicate in a conditional, e.g., `if_` or `while_` could return any type.
For example:

```python
class SomeWorkChain(WorkChain):

    @classmethod
    def define(cls, spec):
        super().define(spec)
        spec.outline(if_(cls.some_conditional)())

    def some_conditional(self):
        if self.ctx.something == 'something':
            return True
```
The `some_conditional` method is used as the "predicate" of the `if_` conditional.
It returns `True` or `None`.
Since the `None` value in Python is "falsey", it would be considered as returning `False`.
However, this duck-typing could accidentally lead to unexpected situations, so we decided to be more strict on the return type.
As of now, a deprecation warning is emitted if the method returns anything that is not "boolean-like", i.e., does not implement the `__bool__` method.
If you see this warning, please make sure to return a boolean, like the built-ins `True` or `False`, or a `numpy.bool` or `aiida.orm.Bool`.
See the [pull request](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/5924) for more details.

### Controlling usage of MPI
It is now possible to define on a code object whether it should be run with or without MPI through the `with_mpi` attribute.
It can be set from the Python API as `AbstractCode(with_mpi=with_mpi)` or through the `--with-mpi / --no-with-mpi` option of the `verdi code create` CLI command.
This option adds a manner to control the use of MPI in calculation jobs, in addition to the existing ones defined by the `CalcJob` plugin and the `metadata.options.withmpi` input.
For more details on how these are controlled and how conflicts are handled, please refer to [the documentation](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/latest/topics/calculations/usage.html#controlling-mpi).

### Add support for Docker containers
Support is added for running calculation within Docker containers.
For example, to run Quantum ESPRESSO pw.x in a Docker container, write the following file to `config.yml`:
```yaml
label: qe-pw-on-docker
computer: localhost
engine_command: docker run -i -v $PWD:/workdir:rw -w /workdir {image_name} sh -c
image_name: haya4kun/quantum_espresso
filepath_executable: pw.x
default_calc_job_plugin: quantumespresso.pw
use_double_quotes: false
wrap_cmdline_params: true
```
and run the CLI command:
```
verdi code create core.code.containerized --config config.yml --non-interactive
```
This should create a `ContainerizedCode` that you can now use to launch a `PwCalculation`.
For more details, please refer to [the documentation](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/latest/topics/data_types.html#supported-container-technologies).

### Exporting code configurations
It is now possible to export the configuration of an existing code through the `verdi code export` command.
The produced YAML file can be used to recreate the code through the `verdi code create` command.
Note that you should use the correct subcommand based on the type of the original code.
For example, if it was an `InstalledCode` you should use `verdi code create core.code.installed`.
For the legacy `Code` instances, you should use `verdi code setup`.
See the [pull request](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/5860) for more details.

## v2.2.1 - 2022-12-22

### Fixes

Unfortunately, the change caused changes performed by `verdi` commands (as well as changes made in `verdi shell`) to not be persisted to the database. [[#5851]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/5851)


## v2.2.0 - 2022-12-13

This feature release comes with a significant feature and a number of improvements and fixes.

### Live calculation job monitoring

In certain use cases, it is useful to have a calculation job stopped prematurely, before it finished or the requested wallclock time runs out.
Examples are calculations that seem to be going nowhere and so continuing would only waste computational resources.
Up till now, a calculation job could only be "manually" stopped, through `verdi process kill`.
In this release, functionality is added that allows calculation jobs to be monitored automatically by the daemon and have them stopped when certain conditions are met.

Monitors can be attached to a calculation job through the `monitors` input namespace:
```python
builder = load_code().get_builder()
builder.monitors = {
    'monitor_a': Dict({'entry_point': 'some.monitor'}),
    'monitor_b': Dict({'entry_point': 'some.other.monitor'}),
}
```
Monitors are referenced by their entry points with which they are registered in the `aiida.calculations.monitors` entry point group.
A monitor is essentially a function that implements the following interface:
```python
from aiida.orm import CalcJobNode
from aiida.transports import Transport

def monitor(node: CalcJobNode, transport: Transport) -> str | CalcJobMonitorResult | None:
    """Retrieve and inspect files in working directory of job to determine whether the job should be killed.

    :param node: The node representing the calculation job.
    :param transport: The transport that can be used to retrieve files from remote working directory.
    :returns: A string if the job should be killed, `None` otherwise.
    """
```
The `transport` allows to fetch files from the working directory of the calculation.
If the job should be killed, the monitor simply returns a string with the message why and the daemon will send the message to kill the job.

For more information and a complete description of the interface, please refer to the [documentation](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/v2.1.0/howto/run_codes.html#how-to-monitor-and-prematurely-stop-a-calculation).
This functionality was accepted based on [AEP 008](https://github.com/aiidateam/AEP/pull/36) which provides more detail on the design choices behind this implementation.

## v2.1.2 - 2022-11-14

### Fixes

- `BaseRestartWorkChain`: Fix bug in `_wrap_bare_dict_inputs` introduced in `v2.1.0` [[#5757]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/5757)


## v2.1.1 - 2022-11-10

### Fixes

- Engine: Remove `*args` from the `Process.submit` method. [[#5753]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/5753)
  Positional arguments were silently ignored leading to a misleading error message.
  For example, if a user called
  ```python
  inputs = {}
  self.submit(cls, inputs)
  ```
  instead of the intended
  ```python
  inputs = {}
  self.submit(cls, **inputs)
  ```
  The returned error message was that one of the required inputs was not defined.
  Now it will correctly raise a `TypeError` saying that positional arguments are not supported.
- Process functions: Add serialization for Python base type defaults [[#5744]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/5744)
  Defining Python base types as defaults, such as:
  ```python
  @calcfunction
  def function(a, b = 5):
      return a + b
  ```
  would raise an exception.
  The default is now automatically serialized, just as an input argument would be upon function call.
- Process control: Reinstate process status for paused/killed processes [[#5754]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/5754)
  Regression introduced in `aiida-core==2.1.0` caused the message `Killed through 'verdi process list'` to no longer be set on the `process_status` of the node.
- `QueryBuilder`: use a nested session in `iterall` and `iterdict` [[#5736]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/5736)
  Modifying entities yielded by `QueryBuilder.iterall` and `QueryBuilder.iterdict` would raise an exception, for example:
  ```python
  for [node] in QueryBuilder().append(Node).iterall():
      node.base.extras.set('some', 'extra')
  ```


## v2.1.0 - 2022-11-07

This feature release comes with a number of new features as well as quite a few fixes of bugs and stability issues.
Further down you will find a complete list of changes, after a short description of some of the most important changes:

- [Automatic input serialization in calculation and work functions](#automatic-input-serialization-in-calculation-and-work-functions)
- [Improved interface for creating codes](#improved-interface-for-creating-codes)
- [Support for running code in containers](#support-for-running-code-in-containers)
- [Control daemon and processes from the API](#control-daemon-and-processes-from-the-api)
- [REST API can serve multiple profiles](#rest-api-can-serve-multiple-profiles)
- [Pluginable data storage backends](#pluginable-data-storage-backends)
- [Full list of changes](#full-list-of-changes)

### Automatic input serialization in calculation and work functions

The inputs to `calcfunction`s and `workfunction`s are now automatically converted to AiiDA data types if they are one of the basic Python types (`bool`, `dict`, `Enum`, `float`, `int`, `list` or `str`).
This means that code that looked like:

```python
from aiida.engine import calcfunction
from aiida.orm import Bool, Float, Int, Str

@calcfunction
def function(switch, threshold, count, label):
    ...

function(Bool(True), Float(0.25), Int(10), Str('some-label'))
```

can now be simplified to:

```python
from aiida.engine import calcfunction
from aiida.orm import Bool, Float, Int, Str

@calcfunction
def function(switch, threshold, count, label):
    ...

function(True, 0.25, 10, 'some-label')
```

### Improved interface for creating codes

The `Code` data plugin was a single class that served two different types of codes: "remote" codes and "local" codes.
These names "remote" and "local" have historically caused a lot of confusion.
Likewise, using a single class `Code` for both implementations also has led to confusing interfaces.

To address this issue, the functionality has been split into two new classes [`InstalledCode`](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/v2.1.0/topics/data_types.html#installedcode) and [`PortableCode`](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/v2.1.0/topics/data_types.html#portablecode), that replace the "remote" and "local" code, respectively.
The installed code represents an executable binary that is already pre-installed on some compute resource.
The portable code represents a code (executable plus any additional required files) that are stored in AiiDA's storage and can be automatically transfered to any computer before being executed.

Creating a new instance of these new code types is easy:
```python
from pathlib import Path
from aiida.orm import InstalledCode, PortableCode

installed_code = InstalledCode(
    label='installed-code',
    computer=load_computer('localhost'),
    filepath_executable='/usr/bin/bash'
)

portable_code = PortableCode(
    label='portable-code',
    filepath_files=Path('/some/path/code'),
    filepath_executable='executable.exe'
)
```

Codes can also be created through the new `verdi` command `verdi code create`.
To specify the type of code to create, pass the corresponding entry point name as an argument.
For example, to create a new installed code, invoke:
```bash
verdi code create core.code.installed
````
The options for each subcommand are automatically generated based on the code type, and so only options that are relevant to that code type will be prompted for.

The new code classes both subclass the `aiida.orm.nodes.data.code.abstract.AbstractCode` base class.
This means that both `InstalledCode`s and `PortableCode`s can be used as the `code` input for `CalcJob`s without problems.

The old `Code` class remains supported for the time being as well, however, it is deprecated and will be remove at some point.
The same goes for the `verdi code setup` command; please use `verdi code create` instead.
Existing codes will be automatically migrated to either an `InstalledCode` or a `PortableCode`.
It is strongly advised that you update any code that creates new codes to use these new plugin types.

### Support for running code in containers

Support is added to run calculation jobs inside a container.
A containerized code can be setup through the CLI:
```bash
verdi code create core.code.containerized \
    --label containerized \
    --image-name docker://alpine:3 \
    --filepath-executable /bin/sh \
    --engine-command "singularity exec --bind $PWD:$PWD {image_name}"
```
as well as through the API:
```python
from aiida.orm import ContainerizedCode, load_computer
code = ContainerizedCode(
    computer=load_computer('some-computer')
    filepath_executable='/bin/sh'
    image_name='docker://alpine:3',
    engine_command='singularity exec --bind $PWD:$PWD {image_name}'
).store()
```
In the example above we use the [Singularity](https://singularity-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) containerization technology.
For more information on what containerization programs are supported and how to configure them, please refer to the [documentation](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/v2.1.0/topics/data_types.html#containerizedcode).

### Control daemon and processes from the API

Up till now, the daemon and live processes could only easily be controlled through `verdi daemon` and `verdi process`, respectively.
In this release, modules are added to provide the same functionality through the Python API.

#### Daemon API

The daemon can now be started and stopped through the `DaemonClient` which can be obtained through the `get_daemon_client` utility function:
```python
from aiida.engine.daemon.client import get_daemon_client
client = get_daemon_client()
```
By default, this will give the daemon client for the current default profile.
It is also possible to explicitly specify a profile:
```python
client = get_daemon_client(profile='some-profile')
```
The daemon can be started and stopped through the client:
```python
client.start_daemon()
assert client.is_daemon_running
client.stop_daemon(wait=True)
```

#### Process API

The functionality of `verdi process` to `play`, `pause` and `kill` is now made available through the `aiida.engine.process.control` module.
Processes can be played, paused or killed through the `play_processes`, `pause_processes`, and `kill_processes`, respectively.
The processes to act upon are defined through their `ProcessNode` which can be loaded using `load_node`.
```python
from aiida.engine.process import control

processes = [load_node(<PK1>), load_node(<PK2>)]

pause_processes(processes)  # Pause the processes
play_processes(processes)  # Play them again
kill_processes(processes)  # Kill the processes
```
Instead of specifying an explicit list of processes, the functions also take the `all_entries` keyword argument:
```python
pause_processes(all_entries=True)  # Pause all running processes
```

### REST API can serve multiple profiles

Before, a single REST API could only serve data of a single profile at a time.
This limitation has been removed and a single REST API instance can now serve data from all profiles of an AiiDA instance.
To maintain backwards compatibility, the new functionality needs to be explicitly enabled through the configuration:
```bash
verdi config set rest_api.profile_switching True
```
After the REST API is restarted, it will now accept the `profile` query parameter, for example:
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v4/computers?profile=some-profile-name
````
If the specified is already loaded, the REST API functions exactly as without profile switching enabled.
If another profile is specified, the REST API will first switch profiles before executing the request.

If the profile parameter is specified in a request and the REST API does not have profile switching enabled, a 400 response is returned.

### Pluginable data storage backends

Warning: this is beta functionality.
It is now possible to implement custom storage backends to control where all data of an AiiDA profile is stored.
To provide a data storage plugin, one should implement the `aiida.orm.implementation.storage_backend.StorageBackend` interface.
The default implementation provided by `aiida-core` is the `aiida.storage.psql_dos.backend.PsqlDosBackend` which uses a PostgreSQL database for the provenance graph and a [`disk-objectstore`](https://pypi.org/project/disk-objectstore/) container for repository files.

Storage backend plugins should be registered in the new entry point group `aiida.storage`.
The default storage backend `PsqlDosBackend` has the `core.psql_dos` entry point name.

The storage backend to be used for a profile can be specified using the `--db-backend` option in `verdi setup` and `verdi quicksetup`.
The entry point of the selected backend is stored in the `storage.backend` key of a profile configuration:
```json
{
    "profiles": {
        "profile-name": {
            "PROFILE_UUID": "",
            "storage": {
                "backend": "core.psql_dos",
                "config": {}
            },
            "process_control": {},
            "default_user_email": "aiida@localhost",
            "test_profile": false
        },

}
```

At the moment, it is not quite clear if the abstract interface `StorageBackend` properly abstracts everything that is needed to implement any storage backend.
For the time being then, it is advised to subclass the `PsqlDosBackend` and replace parts required for the use-case, such as just replacing the file repository implementation.

## v2.0.0 - 2022-04-27

[Full changelog](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/compare/v2.0.0b1...v2.0.0)

This release finalises the [v2.0.0b1 changes](release/2.0.0b1).

### Node namespace restructuring ♻️

:::{note}
The restructuring is fully back-compatible, and existing methods/attributes will continue to work, until aiida-core `v3.0`.

Deprecations warnings are also currently turned **off** by default.
To identify these deprecations in your code base (for example when running unit tests), activate the `AIIDA_WARN_v3` environmental variable:

```bash
export AIIDA_WARN_v3=1
```

:::

The `Node` class (and thus its subclasses) has many methods and attributes in its public namespace.
This has been noted [as being a problem](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/issues/4976) for those using auto-completion,
since it makes it difficult to select suitable methods and attributes.

These methods/attributes have now been partitioned into "sub-namespaces" for specific purposes:

`Node.base.attributes`
: Interface to the attributes of a node instance.

`Node.base.caching`
: Interface to control caching of a node instance.

`Node.base.comments`
: Interface for comments of a node instance.

`Node.base.extras`
: Interface to the extras of a node instance.

`Node.base.links`
: Interface for links of a node instance.

`Node.base.repository`
: Interface to the file repository of a node instance.

### IPython integration improvements 👌

The `aiida` [IPython magic commands](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html) are now available to load via:

```ipython
%load_ext aiida
```

As well as the previous `%aiida` magic command, to load a profile,
one can also use the `%verdi` magic command.
This command runs the `verdi` CLI using the currently loaded profile of the IPython/Jupyter session.

```ipython
%verdi status
```

See the [Basic Tutorial](docs/source/tutorials/basic.md) for example usage.

### New `SqliteTempBackend` ✨

The `SqliteTempBackend` utilises an in-memory SQLite database to store data, allowing it to be transiently created/destroyed within a single Python session, without the need for Postgresql.

As such, it is useful for demonstrations and testing purposes, whereby no persistent storage is required.

To load a temporary profile, you can use the following code:

```python
from aiida import load_profile
from aiida.storage.sqlite_temp import SqliteTempBackend

profile = load_profile(
    SqliteTempBackend.create_profile(
        'myprofile',
        options={
            'runner.poll.interval': 1
        },
        debug=False
    ),
)
```

See the [Basic Tutorial](docs/source/tutorials/basic.md) for example usage.

(release/2.0.0b1)=
## v2.0.0b1 - 2022-03-15

[Full changelog](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/compare/v1.6.7...v2.0.0b1)

The version 2 release of `aiida-core` largely focusses on major improvements to the design of data storage within AiiDA, as well as updates to core dependencies and removal of deprecated APIs.

Assuming users have already addressed deprecation warnings from `aiida-core` v1.6.x, there should be limited impact on existing code.
For plugin developers, the [AiiDA 2.0 plugin migration guide](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/wiki/AiiDA-2.0-plugin-migration-guide) provides a step-by-step guide on how to update their plugins.

For existing profiles and archives, a migration will be required, before they are compatible with the new version.

:::{tip}
Before updating your `aiida-core` installation, it is advisable to make sure you create a full backup of your profiles,
using the current version of `aiida-core` you have installed.
For backup instructions, using aiida-core v1.6.7, see [this documentation](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/v1.6.7/howto/installation.html#backing-up-your-installation).
:::

### Python support updated to 3.8 - 3.10 ⬆️

Following the [NEP 029](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html) timeline, support for Python 3.7 is dropped as of December 26 2021, and support for Python 3.10 is added.

### Plugin entry point updates 🧩

AiiDA's use of entry points, to allow plugins to extend the functionality of AiiDA, is described in the [plugins topic section](docs/source/topics/plugins.rst).

The use of `reentry scan`, for loading plugin entry points, is no longer necessary.

Use of the [reentry](https://pypi.org/project/reentry/) dependency has been replaced by the built-in [importlib.metadata](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.metadata.html) library.
This library requires no additional loading step.

All entry points provided by `aiida-core` now start with a `core.` prefix, to make their origin more explicit and respect the naming guidelines of entry points in the AiiDA ecosystem.
The old names are still supported so as to not suddenly break existing code based on them, but they have now been deprecated.
For example:

```python
from aiida.plugins import DataFactory
Int = DataFactory('int')  # Old name
Int = DataFactory('core.int')  # New name
```

Note that entry point names are also used on the command line. For example:

```console
$ verdi computer setup -L localhost -T local -S direct
# now changed to
$ verdi computer setup -L localhost -T local -S core.direct
```

### Improvements to the AiiDA storage architecture ♻️

Full details on the AiiDA storage architecture are available in the [storage architecture section](docs/source/internals/storage/architecture.rst).

The storage refactor incorporates four major changes:

- The `django` and `sqlalchemy` storage backends have been merged into a single `psql_dos` backend (PostgreSQL + Disk-Objectstore).
  - See the [`psql_dos` storage format](docs/source/internals/storage/psql_dos.rst) for details.
  - This has allowed for the `django` dependency to be dropped.

- The file system node repository has been replaced with an object store implementation.
  - The object store automatically deduplicates files, and allows for the compression of many objects into a single file, thus significantly reducing the number of files on the file system and memory utilisation (by orders of magnitude).
  - Note, to make full use of object compression, one should periodically run `verdi storage maintain`.
  - See the [repository design section](docs/source/internals/storage/repository.rst) for details.

- Command-line interaction with a profile's storage has been moved from `verdi database` to `verdi storage`.

- The AiiDA archive format has been redesigned as the `sqlite_zip` storage backend.
  - See the [`sqlite_zip` storage format](docs/source/internals/storage/sqlite_zip.rst) for details.
  - The new format allows for streaming of data during exports and imports, significantly reducing both the time and memory utilisation of these actions.
  - The archive can now be loaded directly as a (read-only) profile, without the need to import it first, see [this Jupyter Notebook tutorial](docs/source/howto/archive_profile.md).

The storage redesign also allows for profile switching, within the same Python process, and profile access within a context manager.
For example:

```python
from aiida import load_profile, profile_context, orm

with profile_context('my_profile_1'):
    # The profile will be loaded within the context
    node_from_profile_1 = orm.load_node(1)
    # then the profile will be unloaded automatically

# load a global profile
load_profile('my_profile_2')
node_from_profile_2 = orm.load_node(1)

# switch to a different global profile
load_profile('my_profile_3', allow_switch=True)
node_from_profile_3 = orm.load_node(1)
```

See [How to interact with AiiDA](docs/source/howto/interact.rst) for more details.

On first using `aiida-core` v2.0, your AiiDA configuration will be automatically migrated to the new version (this can be reverted by `verdi config downgrade`).
To update existing profiles and archives to the new storage formats, simply use `verdi storage migrate` and `verdi archive migrate`, respectively.

:::{important}
The migration of large storage repositories is a potentially time-consuming process.
It may take several hours to complete, depending on the size of the repository.
It is also advisable to make a full manual backup of any AiiDA setup with important data: see [the installation management section](docs/source/howto/installation.rst) for more information.

See also this [testing of profile migrations](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/discussions/5379), for some indicative timings.

### Improvements to the AiiDA ORM 👌

#### Node repository

Inline with the storage improvements, {class}`~aiida.orm.Node` methods associated with the repository have some backwards incompatible changes:

:::{dropdown} `Node` repository method changes

Altered:

- `FileType`: moved from `aiida.orm.utils.repository` to `aiida.repository.common`
- `File`: moved from `aiida.orm.utils.repository` to `aiida.repository.common`
- `File`: changed from namedtuple to class
- `File`: can no longer be iterated over
- `File`: `type` attribute was renamed to `file_type`
- `Node.put_object_from_tree`: `path` argument was renamed to `filepath`
- `Node.put_object_from_file`: `path` argument was renamed to `filepath`
- `Node.put_object_from_tree`: `key` argument was renamed to `path`
- `Node.put_object_from_file`: `key` argument was renamed to `path`
- `Node.put_object_from_filelike`: `key` argument was renamed to `path`
- `Node.get_object`: `key` argument was renamed to `path`
- `Node.get_object_content`: `key` argument was renamed to `path`
- `Node.open`: `key` argument was renamed to `path`
- `Node.list_objects`: `key` argument was renamed to `path`
- `Node.list_object_names`: `key` argument was renamed to `path`
- `SinglefileData.open`: `key` argument was renamed to `path`
- `Node.open`: can no longer be called without context manager
- `Node.open`: only mode `r` and `rb` are supported, [use `put_object_from_` methods instead](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/issues/4721#issuecomment-920100415)
- `Node.get_object_content`: only mode `r` and `rb` are supported
- `Node.put_object_from_tree`: argument `contents_only` was removed
- `Node.put_object_from_tree`: argument `force` was removed
- `Node.put_object_from_file`: argument `force` was removed
- `Node.put_object_from_filelike`: argument `force` was removed
- `Node.delete_object`: argument `force` was removed

Added:

- `Node.walk`
- `Node.copy_tree`
- `Node.is_valid_cache` setter
- `Node.objects.iter_repo_keys`

Additionally, `Node.open` should always be used as a context manager, for example:

```python
with node.open('filename.txt') as handle:
    content = handle.read()
```

:::

#### QueryBuilder

When using the {class}`~aiida.orm.QueryBuilder` to query the database, the following changes have been made:

- The `Computer`'s `name` field is now replaced with `label` (as previously deprecated in v1.6)
- The `QueryBuilder.queryhelp` attribute is deprecated, for the `as_dict` (and `from_dict`) methods
- The `QueryBuilder.first` method now allows the `flat` argument, which will return a single item, instead of a list of one item, if only a single projection is defined.

For example:

```python
from aiida.orm import QueryBuilder, Computer
query = QueryBuilder().append(Computer, filters={'label': 'localhost'}, project=['label']).as_dict()
QueryBuilder.from_dict(query).first(flat=True)  # -> 'localhost'
```

For further information, see [How to find and query for data](docs/source/howto/query.rst).

#### Dict usage

The {class}`~aiida.orm.Dict` class has been updated to support more native `dict` behaviour:

- Initialisation can now use `Dict({'a': 1})`, instead of `Dict(dict={'a': 1})`. This is also the case for `List([1, 2])`.
- Equality (`==`/`!=`) comparisons now compare the dictionaries, rather than the UUIDs
- The contains (`in`) operator now returns `True` if the dictionary contains the key
- The `items` method iterates a list of `(key, value)` pairs

For example:

```python
from aiida.orm import Dict

d1 = Dict({'a': 1})
d2 = Dict({'a': 1})

assert d1.uuid != d2.uuid
assert d1 == d2
assert not d1 != d2

assert 'a' in d1

assert list(d1.items()) == [('a', 1)]
```

#### New data types

Two new built-in data types have been added:

{class}`~aiida.orm.EnumData`
: A data plugin that wraps a Python `enum.Enum` instance.

{class}`~aiida.orm.JsonableData`
: A data plugin that allows one to easily wrap existing objects that are JSON-able (via an `as_dict` method).

See the [data types section](docs/source/topics/data_types.rst) for more information.

### Improvements to the AiiDA process engine 👌

#### CalcJob API

A number of minor improvements have been made to the `CalcJob` API:

- Both numpy arrays and `Enum` instances can now be serialized on process checkpoints.
- The `Calcjob.spec.metadata.options.rerunnable` option allows to specify whether the calculation can be rerun or requeued (dependent on the scheduler). Note, this should only be applied for idempotent codes.
- The `Calcjob.spec.metadata.options.environment_variables_double_quotes` option allows for double-quoting of environment variable declarations. In particular, this allows for use of the `$` character in the environment variable name, e.g. `export MY_FILE="$HOME/path/my_file"`.
- `CalcJob.local_copy_list` now allows for specifying entire directories to be copied to the local computer, in addition to individual files. Note that the directory itself won't be copied, just its contents.
- `WorkChain.to_context` now allows `.` delimited namespacing, which generate nested dictionaries. See [Nested context keys](docs/source/topics/workflows/usage.rst) for more information.

#### Importing existing computations

The new `CalcJobImporter` class has been added, to define importers for computations completed outside of AiiDA.
These can help onboard new users to your AiiDA plugin.
For more information, see [Writing importers for existing computations](docs/source/howto/plugin_codes.rst).

#### Scheduler plugins

Plugin's implementation of `Scheduler._get_submit_script_header` should now utilise `Scheduler._get_submit_script_environment_variables`, to format environment variable declarations, rather than handling it themselves. See the exemplar changes in [#5283](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/5283).

The `Scheduler.get_valid_transports()` method has also been removed, use `get_entry_point_names('aiida.schedulers')` instead (see {func}`~aiida.plugins.entry_point.get_entry_point_names`).

See [Scheduler plugins](docs/source/topics/schedulers.rst) for more information.

#### Transport plugins

The `SshTransport` now supports the SSH `ProxyJump` option, for tunnelling through other SSH hosts.
See [How to setup SSH connections](docs/source/howto/ssh.rst) for more information.

Transport plugins now support also transferring bytes (rather than only Unicode strings) in the stdout/stderr of "remote" commands (see [#3787](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/3787)).
The required changes for transport plugins:

- rename the `exec_command_wait` function in your plugin implementation with `exec_command_wait_bytes`
- ensure the method signature follows {meth}`~aiida.transports.transport.Transport.exec_command_wait_bytes`, and that `stdin` accepts a `bytes` object.
- return bytes for stdout and stderr (most probably internally you are already getting bytes - just do not decode them to strings)

For an exemplar implementation, see {meth}`~aiida.transports.plugins.local.LocalTransport.exec_command_wait_bytes`,
or see [Transport plugins](docs/source/topics/transport.rst) for more information.

The `Transport.get_valid_transports()` method has also been removed, use `get_entry_point_names('aiida.transports')` instead (see {func}`~aiida.plugins.entry_point.get_entry_point_names`).

### Improvements to the AiiDA command-line 👌

The AiiDA command-line interface (CLI) can now be accessed as both `verdi` and `/path/to/bin/python -m aiida`.

The underlying dependency for this CLI, `click`, has been updated to version 8, which contains built-in tab-completion support, to replace the old `click-completion`.
The completion works the same, except that the string that should be put in the activation script to enable it is now shell-dependent.
See [Activating tab-completion](docs/source/howto/installation.rst) for more information.

Logging for the CLI has been updated, to standardise its use across all CLI commands.
This means that all commands include the option:

```console
  -v, --verbosity [notset|debug|info|report|warning|error|critical]
                                  Set the verbosity of the output.
```

By default the verbosity is set to `REPORT` (see `verdi config list`), which relates to using `Logger.report`, as defined in {func}`~aiida.common.log.report`.

The following specific changes and improvements have been made to the CLI commands:

`verdi storage` (replaces `verdi database`)
: This command group replaces the `verdi database` command group, which is now deprecated, in order to represent its interaction with the full profile storage (not just database).
: `verdi storage info` provides information about the entities contained for a profile.
: `verdi storage maintain` has also been added, to allow for maintenance of the storage, for example, to optimise the storage size.

`verdi archive version` and `verdi archive info` (replace `verdi archive inspect`)
: This change synchronises the commands with the new `verdi storage version` and `verdi storage info` commands.

`verdi group move-nodes`
: This command moves nodes from a source group to a target group (removing them from one and adding them to the other).

`verdi code setup`
: There is a small change to the order of prompts, in interactive mode.
: The uniqueness of labels is now validated, for both remote and local codes.

`verdi code test`
: Run tests for a given code to check whether it is usable, including whether remote executable files are available.

See [AiiDA Command Line](docs/source/reference/command_line.rst) for more information.

### Development improvements

The build tool for `aiida-core` has been changed from `setuptools` to [`flit`](https://github.com/pypa/flit).
This allows for the project metadata to be fully specified in the `pyproject.toml` file, using the [PEP 621](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621) format.
Note, editable installs (using the `-e` flag for `pip install`) of `aiida-core` now require `pip>=21`.

[Type annotations](https://peps.python.org/pep-0526/) have been added to most of the code base.
Plugin developers can use [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io) to check their code against the new type annotations.

All module level imports are now defined explicitly in `__all__`.
See [Overview of public API](docs/source/reference/api/public.rst) for more information.

The `aiida.common.json` module is now deprecated.
Use the `json` standard library instead.

#### Changes to the plugin test fixtures 🧪

The deprecated `AiidaTestCase` class has been removed, in favour of the AiiDA pytest fixtures, which can be loaded in your `conftest.py` using:

```python
pytest_plugins = ['aiida.manage.tests.pytest_fixtures']
```

The fixtures `clear_database`, `clear_database_after_test`, `clear_database_before_test` are now deprecated, in favour of the `aiida_profile_clean` fixture, which ensures (before the test) the default profile is reset with clean storage, and that all previous resources are closed
If you only require the profile to be reset before a class of tests, then you can use `aiida_profile_clean_class`.

## v1.6.4 - 2021-06-23

[full changelog](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/compare/v1.6.3...v1.6.4)

This is a patch release to pin `psycopg2-binary` to version 2.8.x, to avoid an issue with database creation in version 2.9 ([#4989](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4989)).

## v1.6.3 - 2021-04-28

[full changelog](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/compare/v1.6.2...v1.6.3) | [GitHub contributors page for this release](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/graphs/contributors?from=2021-04-281&to=2021-04-28&type=c)

This is a patch release to fix a bug that was introduced in `v1.6.2` that would cause a number of `verdi` commands to fail due to a bug in the `with_dbenv` decorator utility.

### Bug fixes
- Fix `aiida.cmdline.utils.decorators.load_backend_if_not_loaded` [[#4878]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4878)


## v1.6.2 - 2021-04-28

[full changelog](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/compare/v1.6.1...v1.6.2) | [GitHub contributors page for this release](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/graphs/contributors?from=2021-03-31&to=2021-04-27&type=c)

### Bug fixes
- CLI: Use the proper proxy command for `verdi calcjob gotocomputer` if configured as such [[#4761]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4761)
- Respect nested output namespaces in `Process.exposed_outputs` [[#4863]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4863)
- `NodeLinkManager` now properly regenerates original nested namespaces from the flat link labels stored in the database. This means one can now do `node.outputs.some.nested.output` instead of having to do `node.outputs.some__nested__output`. The same goes for `node.inputs` [[#4625]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4625)
- Fix `aiida.cmdline.utils.decorators.with_dbenv` always loading the database. Now it will only load the database if not already loaded, as intended [[#4865]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4865)

- Add the `account` option to the `LsfScheduler` scheduler plugin [[#4832]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4832)

### Documentation
- Update ssh proxycommand section with instructions on how to handle cases where the SSH key needs to be specified for the proxy server [[#4839]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4839)
- Add the ["How to extend workflows"](https://aiida-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/write_workflows.html#extending-workflows) section, explaining the use of the `expose_inputs` and `expose_outputs` features, as well as nested namespaces [[#4562]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4562)
- Add help in intro for when quicksetup fails due to problems autodetecting the PostgreSQL settings [[#4838]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4838)


## v1.6.1 - 2021-03-31

[full changelog](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/compare/v1.6.0...v1.6.1) | [GitHub contributors page for this release](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/graphs/contributors?from=2021-03-15&to=2021-03-31&type=c)

This patch release is primarily intended to fix a regression in the `aiida_profile` test fixture, used by plugin developers, causing config validation errors ([#4831](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4831)).

Other additions:

- ✨ NEW: Added `structure.data.import` entry-point, allowing for plugins to define file-format specific sub-commands of `verdi data structure import` ([#4427](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4427)).
- ✨ NEW: Added `--label` and `--group` options to `verdi data structure import`, which apply a label/group to all structures being imported ([#4429](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4429)).
- ⬆️ UPDATE: `psgu` dependency increased to `v0.2.x`.
  This fixes a bug in `verdi quicksetup`, when used on the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) platform ([#4834](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4834)).
- 🐛 FIX: `metadata.options.max_memory_kb` is now ignored when using the direct scheduler ([#4825](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4825)).
  This was previously imposing a a virtual memory limit with `ulimit -v`, which is very different to the physical memory limit that other scheduler plugins impose. No straightforward way exists to directly limit the physical memory usage for this scheduler.
- 🐛 FIX: Added `__str__` method to the `Orbital` class, fixing a recursion error ([#4829](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4829)).

## v1.6.0 - 2021-03-15

[full changelog](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/compare/v1.5.2...v1.6.0) | [GitHub contributors page for this release](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/graphs/contributors?from=2020-12-07&to=2021-03-15&type=c)

As well as introducing a number of improvements and new features listed below, this release marks the "under-the-hood" migration from the `tornado` package to the Python built-in module `asyncio`, for handling asynchronous processing within the AiiDA engine.
This removes a number of blocking dependency version clashes with other tools, in particular with the newest Jupyter shell and notebook environments.
The migration does not present any backward incompatible changes to AiiDA's public API.
A substantial effort has been made to test and debug the new implementation, and ensure it performs at least equivalent to the previous code (or improves it!), but please let us know if you uncover any additional issues.

This release also drops support for Python 3.6 (testing is carried out against `3.7`, `3.8` and `3.9`).

NOTE: `v1.6` is tentatively intended to be the final minor `v1.x` release before `v2.x`, that will include a new file repository implementation and remove all deprecated code.

### New calculation features ✨

The `additional_retrieve_list` metadata option has been added to `CalcJob` ([#4437](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4437)).
This new option allows one to specify additional files to be retrieved on a per-instance basis, in addition to the files that are already defined by the plugin to be retrieved.

A **new namespace `stash`** has bee added to the `metadata.options` input namespace of the `CalcJob` process ([#4424](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4424)).
This option namespace allows a user to specify certain files that are created by the calculation job to be stashed somewhere on the remote.
This can be useful if those files need to be stored for a longer time than the scratch space (where the job was run) is available for, but need to be kept on the remote machine and not retrieved.
Examples are files that are necessary to restart a calculation but are too big to be retrieved and stored permanently in the local file repository.

See [Stashing files on the remote](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/v1.6.0/topics/calculations/usage.html#stashing-files-on-the-remote) for more details.

The **new `TransferCalcjob` plugin** ([#4194](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4194)) allows the user to copy files between a remote machine and the local machine running AiiDA.
More specifically, it can do any of the following:

- Take any number of files from any number of `RemoteData` folders in a remote machine and copy them in the local repository of a single newly created `FolderData` node.
- Take any number of files from any number of `FolderData` nodes in the local machine and copy them in a single newly created `RemoteData` folder in a given remote machine.

See the [Transferring data](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/v1.6.0/howto/data.html#transferring-data) how-to for more details.

### Profile configuration improvements 👌

The way the global/profile configuration is accessed has undergone a number of distinct changes ([#4712](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4712)):

- When loaded, the `config.json` (found in the `.aiida` folder) is now validated against a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) that can be found in [`aiida/manage/configuration/schema`](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/tree/develop/aiida/manage/configuration/schema).
- The schema includes a number of new global/profile options, including: `transport.task_retry_initial_interval`, `transport.task_maximum_attempts`, `rmq.task_timeout` and `logging.aiopika_loglevel` ([#4583](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4583)).
- The `cache_config.yml` has now also been **deprecated** and merged into the `config.json`, as part of the profile options.
  This merge will be handled automatically, upon first load of the `config.json` using the new AiiDA version.

In-line with these changes, the `verdi config` command has been refactored into separate commands, including `verdi config list`, `verdi config set`, `verdi config unset` and `verdi config caching`.

See the [Configuring profile options](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/v1.6.0/howto/installation.html#configuring-profile-options) and [Configuring caching](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/v1.6.0/howto/run_codes.html#how-to-save-compute-time-with-caching) how-tos for more details.

### Command-line additions and improvements 👌

In addition to `verdi config`, numerous other new commands and options have been added to `verdi`:

- **Deprecated** `verdi export` and `verdi import` commands (replaced by new `verdi archive`) ([#4710](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4710))
- Added `verdi group delete --delete-nodes`, to also delete the nodes in a group during its removal ([#4578](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4578)).
- Improved `verdi group remove-nodes` command to warn when requested nodes are not in the specified group ([#4728](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4728)).
- Added `exception` to the projection mapping of `verdi process list`, for example to use in debugging as: `verdi process list -S excepted -P ctime pk exception` ([#4786](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4786)).
- Added `verdi database summary` ([#4737](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4737)):
  This prints a summary of the count of each entity and (optionally) the list of unique identifiers for some entities.
- Improved `verdi process play` performance, by only querying for active processes with the `--all` flag ([#4671](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4671))
- Added the `verdi database version` command ([#4613](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4613)):
  This shows the schema generation and version of the database of the given profile, useful mostly for developers when debugging.
- Improved `verdi node delete` performance ([#4575](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4575)):
  The logic has been re-written to greatly reduce the time to delete large amounts of nodes.
- Fixed `verdi quicksetup --non-interactive`, to ensure it does not include any user prompts ([#4573](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4573))
- Fixed `verdi --version` when used in editable mode ([#4576](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4576))

### API additions and improvements 👌

The base `Node` class now evaluates equality based on the node's UUID ([#4753](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4753)).
For example, loading the same node twice will always resolve as equivalent: `load_node(1) == load_node(1)`.
Note that existing, class specific, equality relationships will still override the base class behaviour, for example: `Int(99) == Int(99)`, even if the nodes have different UUIDs.
This behaviour for subclasses is still under discussion at: <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/issues/1917>

When hashing nodes for use with the caching features, `-0.` is now converted to `0.`, to reduce issues with differing hashes before/after node storage ([#4648](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4648)).
Known failure modes for hashing are now also raised with the `HashingError` exception ([#4778](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4778)).

Both `aiida.tools.delete_nodes` ([#4578](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4578)) and `aiida.orm.to_aiida_type` ([#4672](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4672)) have been exposed for use in the public API.

A `pathlib.Path` instance can now be used for the `file` argument of `SinglefileData` ([#3614](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/3614))

Type annotations have been added to all inputs/outputs of functions and methods in `aiida.engine` ([#4669](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4669)) and `aiida/orm/nodes/processes` ([#4772](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4772)).
As outlined in [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/), this improves static code analysis and, for example, allows for better auto-completion and type checking in many code editors.

### New REST API Query endpoint ✨

The `/querybuilder` endpoint is the first POST method available for AiiDA's RESTful API ([#4337](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4337))

The POST endpoint returns what the QueryBuilder would return, when providing it with a proper `queryhelp` dictionary ([see the documentation here](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/latest/topics/database.html#the-queryhelp)).
Furthermore, it returns the entities/results in the "standard" REST API format - with the exception of `link_type` and `link_label` keys for links (these particular keys are still present as `type` and `label`, respectively).

For security, POST methods can be toggled on/off with the `verdi restapi --posting/--no-posting` options (it is on by default).
Although note that this option is not yet strictly public, since its naming may be changed in the future!

See [AiiDA REST API documentation](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/latest/reference/rest_api.html) for more details.

### Additional Changes

- Fixed the direct scheduler which, in combination with `SshTransport`, was hanging on submit command ([#4735](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4735)).
  In the ssh transport, to emulate 'chdir', the current directory is now kept in memory, and every command prepended with `cd FOLDER_NAME && ACTUALCOMMAND`.

- In `aiida.tools.ipython.ipython_magics`, `load_ipython_extension` has been **deprecated** in favour of `register_ipython_extension` ([#4548](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4548)).

- Refactored `.ci/` folder to make tests more portable and easier to understand ([#4565](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4565))
  The `ci/` folder had become cluttered, containing configuration and scripts for both the GitHub Actions and Jenkins CI.
  This change moved the GH actions specific scripts to `.github/system_tests`, and refactored the Jenkins setup/tests to use [molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io) in the `.molecule/` folder.

- For aiida-core development, the pytest `requires_rmq` marker and `config_with_profile` fixture have been added ([#4739](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4739) and [#4764](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4764))

### Dependencies
- Update requirement `pytest~=6.0` and use `pyproject.toml` [[#4410]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4410)

### Archive (import/export) refactor
- The refactoring goal was to pave the way for the implementation of a new archive format in v2.0.0 ([ aiidateamAEP005](https://github.com/aiidateam/AEP/pull/21))
- Three abstract+concrete interface classes are defined; writer, reader, migrator, which are **independent of theinternal structure of the archive**. These classes are used within the export/import code.
- The code in `aiida/tools/importexport` has been largely re-written, in particular adding `aiida/toolsimportexport/archive`, which contains this code for interfacing with an archive, and **does not require connectionto an AiiDA profile**.
- The export logic has been re-written; to minimise required queries (faster), and to allow for "streaming" datainto the writer (minimise RAM requirement with new format). It is intended that a similiar PR will be made for the import code.
- A general progress bar implementation is now available in `aiida/common/progress_reporter.py`. All correspondingCLI commands now also have `--verbosity` option.
- Merged PRs:
    - Refactor export archive ([#4448](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4448) & [#4534](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4534))
    - Refactor import archive ([#4510](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4510))
    - Refactor migrate archive ([#4532](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4532))
    - Add group extras to archive ([#4521](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4521))
    - Refactor cmdline progress bar ([#4504](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4504) & [#4522](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4522))
- Updated archive version from `0.9` -> `0.10` ([#4561](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/4561)
- Deprecations: `export_zip`, `export_tar`, `export_tree`, `extract_zip`, `extract_tar` and `extract_tree`functions. `silent` key-word in the `export` function
- Removed: `ZipFolder` class

## v1.0.0

### Overview of changes

The following is a summary of the major changes and improvements from `v0.12.*` to `v1.0.0`.

- Faster workflow engine: the new message-based engine powered by RabbitMQ supports tens of thousands of processes per hour and greatly speeds up workflow testing. You can now run one daemon per AiiDA profile.
- Faster database queries: the switch to JSONB for node attributes and extras greatly improves query speed and reduces storage size by orders of magnitude.
- Robust calculations: AiiDA now deals with network connection issues (automatic retries with backoff mechanism, connection pooling, ...) out of the box. Workflows and calculations are all Processes and can be "paused" and "played" anytime.
- Better verdi commands: the move to the `click` framework brings homogenous command line options across all commands (loading nodes, ...). You can easily add new commands through plugins.
- Easier workflow development: Input and output namespaces, reusing specs of sub-processes and less boilerplate code simplify writing WorkChains and CalcJobs, while also enabling powerful auto-documentation features.
- Mature provenance model: Clear separation between data provenance (Calculations, Data) and logical provenance (Workflows). Old databases can be migrated to the new model automatically.
- python3 compatible: AiiDA 1.0 is compatible with both python 2.7 and python 3.6 (and later). Python 2 support will be dropped in the coming months.

## v0.7.0

This release introduces a lot and significant changes & enhancements.

We worked on our new backend and now AiiDA can be installed using SQLAlchemy too. Many of the verdi
commands and functionalities have been tested and are working with this backend. The full JSON
support provided by SQLAlchemy and the latest versions of PostgreSQL enable significant speed
increase in attribute related queries. SQLAlchemy backend choice is a beta option since some last
functionalities and commands need to be implemented or improved for this backend. Scripts are
provided for the transition of databases from Django backend to SQLAlchemy backend.

In this release we have included a new querying tool called `QueryBuilder`. It is a powerfull tool
allowing users to write complex graph queries to explore the AiiDA graph database. It provides
various features like selection of entity properties, filtering of results, combination of entities
on specific properties as well as various ways to obtain the final result. It also provides the
users an abstract way to query their data without enforcing them to write backend dependent queries.

Last but not least we have included a new workflow engine (in beta version) which is available
through the `verdi workflow2` command. The new workflows are easier to write (it is as close as
writing python as possible), there is seamless mixing of short running tasks with long running
(remote) tasks and they encourage users to write reusable workflows. Moreover, debugging of
workflows has been made easier and it is possible both in-IDE and through logging.

### List of changes:
- Installation procedure works with SQLAlchemy backend too (SQLAlchemy option is still in beta).
- Most of the verdi commands work with SQLAlchemy backend.
- Transition script from Django schema of version 0.7.0 to SQLAlchemy schema of version 0.7.0.
- AiiDA daemon redesigned and working with both backends (Django & SQLAlchemy).
- Introducing new workflow engine that allows better debugging and easier to write workflows. It is
available under the `verdi workflows2` command. Examples are also added.
- Old workflows are still supported and available under the "verdi workflow" command.
- Introducing new querying tool (called `QueryBuilder`). It allows to easily write complex graph
queries that will be executed on the AiiDA graph database. Extensive documentation also added.
- Unifying behaviour of verdi commands in both backends.
- Upped to version 0.4.2 of plum (needed for workflows2)
- Implemented the validator and input helper for Quantum ESPRESSO pw.x.
- Improved the documentation for the pw (and cp) input plugins (for all the flags in the Settings
node).
- Fixed a wrong behavior in the QE pw/cp plugins when checking for the parser options and checking
if there were further unknown flags in the Settings node. However, this does not solve yet
completely the problem (see issue #219).
- Implemented validator and input helper for Quantum ESPRESSO pw.x.
- Added elements with Z=104-112, 114 and 116, in `aiida.common.constants`.
- Added method `set_kpoints_mesh_from_density` in `KpointsData` class.
- Improved incremental backup documentation.
- Added backup related tests.
- Added an option to `test_pw.py` to run also in serial.
- SSH transport, to connect to remote computers via SSH/SFTP.
- Support for the SGE and SLURM schedulers.
- Support for Quantum ESPRESSO Car-Parrinello calculations.
- Support for data nodes to store electronic bands, phonon dispersion and generally arrays defined
over the Brillouin zone.


## v0.6.0

We performed a lot of changes to introduce in one of our following releases a second
object-relational mapper (we will refer to it as back-end) for the management of the used DBMSs and
more specifically of PostgreSQL. SQLAlchemy and the latest version of PostgreSQL allows AiiDA to
store JSON documents directly to the database and also to query them. Moreover the JSON query
optimization is left to the database including also the use of the JSON specific indexes. There was
major code restructuring to accommodate the new back-end resulting to abstracting many classes of
the orm package of AiiDA.

Even if most of the needed restructuring & code addition has been finished, a bit of more work is
needed. Therefore even in this version, Django is the only available back-end for the end user.

However, the users have to update their AiiDA configuration files by executing the migration file
that can be found at `YOUR_AIIDA_DIR/aiida/common/additions/migration.py` as the Linux user that
installed AiiDA in your system.
(e.g. `python YOUR_AIIDA_DIR/aiida/common/additions/migration.py`)

### List of changes:
- Back-end selection (Added backend selection). SQLAlchemy selection is disabled for the moment.
- Migration scripts for the configuration files of AiiDA (SQLAlchemy support).
- Enriched link description in the database (to enrich the provenance model).
- Corrections for numpy array and cell. List will be used with cell.
- Fixed backend import. Verdi commands load as late as possible the needed backend.
- Abstraction of the basic AiiDA orm classes (like node, computer, data etc). This is needed to
support different backends (e.g. Django and SQLAlchemy).
- Fixes on the structure import from QE-input files.
- SQLAlchemy and Django benchmarks.
- UltraJSON support.
- requirements.txt now also include SQLAlchemy and its dependencies.
- Recursive way of loading JSON for SQLAlchemy.
- Improved way of accessing calculations and workflows attached to a workflow step.
- Added methods to programmatically create new codes and computers.

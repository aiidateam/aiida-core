"""
This module contains basic entities of the DB: calc and data (and possibly
others in the future).

Probably the baseclass should be defined here and objects should inherit from
it, to define fields that should go in a DB, and ForeignKeys.

This class should also define probably the 'store' methods, and must have
a 'table' field to say in which DB table the things should be stored.

    This method loops on the RUNNING workflows and handled the execution of the steps until
    each workflow reaches an end (or gets stopped for errors).
    
    In the loop for each RUNNING workflow the method loops also in each of its RUNNING steps,
    testing if all the calculation and subworkflows attached to the step are FINISHED. In this
    case the step is set as FINISHED and the workflow is advanced to the step's next method present 
    in the db with ``advance_workflow``, otherwise if any step's Calculation is found in NEW state 
    the method will submit. If none of the previous conditions apply the step is flagged as 
    ERROR and cannot proceed anymore, blocking the future execution of the step and, connected, 
    the workflow. 
      
    Finally, for each workflow the method tests if there are INITIALIZED steps to be launched,
    and in case reloads the workflow and execute the specific those steps. In case or error
    the step is flagged in ERROR state and the stack is reported in the workflow report.

Python style
++++++++++++
When writing python code, a more than reasonable guideline is given by
the Google python styleguide
http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html.
The documentation should be written consistently in the style of
sphinx.

And more generally, write verbose! Will you remember
after a month why you had to write that check on that line? (Hint: no)
Write comments!

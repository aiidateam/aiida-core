Using the proxy_command option with ssh
#######################################

This page explains how to use the ``proxy_command`` feature of ``ssh``. This feature
is needed when you want to connect to a computer ``B``, but you are not allowed to
connect directly to it; instead, you have to connect to computer ``A`` first, and then
perform a further connection from ``A`` to ``B``.


Requirements
++++++++++++
The idea is that you ask ``ssh`` to connect to computer ``B`` by using
a proxy to create a sort of tunnel. One way to perform such an
operation is to use ``netcat``, a tool that simply takes the standard input and
redirects it to a given TCP port.

Therefore, a requirement is to install ``netcat`` on computer A. 
You can already check if the ``netcat`` or ``nc`` command is available
on you computer, since some distributions include it (if it is already
installed, the output of the command::

  which netcat

or::

  which nc

will return the absolute path to the executable).

If this is not the case, you will need to install it on your own.
Typically, it will be sufficient to look for a netcat distribution on
the web, unzip the downloaded package, ``cd`` into the folder and
execute something like::

  ./configure --prefix=.
  make
  make install

This usually creates a subfolder ``bin``, containing the ``netcat``
and ``nc`` executables.
Write down the full path to ``nc`` that we will need later.


ssh/config
++++++++++
You can now test the proxy command with ``ssh``. Edit the
``~/.ssh/config`` file on the computer on which you installed AiiDA
(or create it if missing) and add the following lines::
  
  Host FULLHOSTNAME_B
  Hostname FULLHOSTNAME_B
  User USER_B
  ProxyCommand ssh USER_A@FULLHOSTNAME_A ABSPATH_NETCAT %h %p

where you have to replace:

* ``FULLHOSTNAMEA`` and ``FULLHOSTNAMEB`` with
  the fully-qualified hostnames of computer ``A`` and ``B`` (remembering that ``B``
  is the computer you want to actually connect to, and ``A`` is the
  intermediate computer to which you have direct access)
* ``USER_A`` and ``USER_B`` are the usernames on the two machines (that 
  can possibly be the same).
* ``ABSPATH_NETCAT`` is the absolute path to the ``nc`` executable
  that you obtained in the previous step.

Remember also to configure passwordless ssh connections using ssh keys
both from your computer to ``A``, and from ``A`` to ``B``.

Once you add this lines and save the file, try to execute::
  
  ssh FULLHOSTNAME_B

which should allow you to directly connect to ``B``.


WARNING
+++++++

There are several versions of netcat available on the web.
We found at least one case in which the executable wasn't working
properly.
At the end of the connection, the ``netcat`` executable might still be
running: as a result, you may rapidly
leave the cluster with hundreds of opened ``ssh`` connections, one for
every time you connect to the cluster ``B``.
Therefore, check on both computers ``A`` and ``B`` that the number of
processes ``netcat`` and ``ssh`` are disappearing if you close the
connection.
To check if such processes are running, you can execute::

  ps -aux | grep <username>

Remember that a cluster might have more than one login node, and the ``ssh``
connection will randomly connect to any of them.


AiiDA config
++++++++++++
If the above steps work, setup and configure now the computer as
explained :ref:`here <computer_setup>`.

If you properly set up the ``~/.ssh/config`` file in the previous
step, AiiDA should properly parse the information in the file and
provide the correct default value for the ``proxy_command`` during the
``verdi computer configure`` step.

.. _ssh_proxycommand_notes:

Some notes on the ``proxy_command`` option
------------------------------------------

* In the ``~/.ssh/config`` file, you can leave the ``%h`` and ``%p``
  placeholders, that are then automatically replaced by ssh with the hostname
  and the port of the machine ``B`` when creating the proxy.
  However, in the AiiDA ``proxy_command`` option, you need to put the
  actual hostname and port. If you start from a properly configured 
  ``~/.ssh/config`` file, AiiDA will already replace these
  placeholders with the correct values. However, if you input the ``proxy_command``
  value manually, remember to write the
  hostname and the port and not ``%h`` and ``%p``.
* In the ``~/.ssh/config`` file, you can also insert stdout and stderr
  redirection, e.g. ``2> /dev/null`` to hide any error that may occur
  during the proxying/tunneling. However, you should only give AiiDA
  the actual command to be executed, without any redirection. Again,
  AiiDA will remove the redirection when it automatically reads the
  ``~/.ssh/config`` file, but be careful if entering manually the
  content in this field.

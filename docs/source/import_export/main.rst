AiiDA Graphs
============

AiiDA offers tools for exporting selected parts of an AiiDA graph to a file for backup or sharing purposes.

Export
++++++

Use ``verdi export create`` to export a selection of nodes, codes, groups, users, or computers.

* **Selection:** Nodes can be selected via identifier (PK, UUID, label) or by exporting predefined groups of nodes.
* **Augmentation:** By default, the export function augments the selection of nodes by their parents in order to preserve the provenance.
  For calculation nodes, the direct outputs are also added.
  By default, comments and logs are also added for each exported node.
  These may be excluded using the proper flags.
  There are several other options to export specific parts of the provenance graph, starting from the selection.
  For more information about this please read the :ref:`corresponding subsection<consistency>` of the :ref:`Provenance section<concepts_provenance>`.
* **File content:** The export file contains all information pertaining to the exported nodes: both the information stored in the database and files stored in the AiiDA repository.
* **Compression:** By default, the export file is compressed using gzip, creating a tar ball (tar.gz).
  It is also possible to create a compressed or uncompressed zip file.

See ``verdi export create -h`` for a full list of available options.

Import
++++++

Use ``verdi import`` to import an AiiDA export archive generated by ``verdi export create``, either a local file or an URL.

* **Duplication:** AiiDA will avoid identifier collisions and node duplication based on UUIDs or email comparisons.
* **Merging:** By default, all existing entities will be updated with the most recent changes.
  Node extras and comments have special modes for determining how to import them.

See ``verdi import -h`` for a full list of available options and their descriptions.

Export File Format
++++++++++++++++++

An AiiDA export file is an archive of ``.zip`` or ``.tar.gz`` format with the following content:

* ``metadata.json`` file containing information on the version of AiiDA as well as the database schema.
* ``data.json`` file containing the exported nodes and their links.
* ``nodes/`` directory containing the repository files corresponding to the exported nodes.

.. _metadata-json:

``metadata.json``
-----------------

This file contains important information, and it is necessary for the correct interpretation of ``data.json``.
Apart from the data schema, the AiiDA and export versions are also mentioned.
This is used to avoid any incompatibilities among different versions of AiiDA.
It should be noted that the schema described in ``metadata.json`` is related to the data itself - abstracted schema focused on the extracted information - and not how the data is stored in the database (database schema).
This makes the import/export mechanism transparent to the database system used, backend selected and how the data is organised in the database (database schema).

Let's have a look at the contents of ``metadata.json``:

            "requires": "User"
          }
        }
      }
    }

At the beginning of the file, we see the version of the export file and the version of the AiiDA code.

The entities that are exported are mentioned in *unique_identifiers* with their respective unique identifiers.
Knowing the unique IDs is useful for duplicate avoidance (in order to avoid the insertion of the node multiple times).

Then in *all_fields_info*, the properties of each entity are mentioned.
The correlations with other entities are also mentioned.
For example, the entity *Node* is related to a *Computer* and a *User*.
The corresponding entity names appear nested next to the properties to show this correlation.

.. note::

    If you have migrated an export archive to the newest export version, there may be an extra entry in ``metadata.json``.
    This simply states from which export version the archive was migrated.

.. note::

    If you supply an old export archive that the current AiiDA code does not support, ``verdi import`` will automatically try to migrate the archive by calling ``verdi export migrate``.

        "20063": {}
      }
    }

At the start of the JSON file shown above, the links among the various AiiDA nodes are stated (*links_uuid* field).
For every link the UUIDs (universal unique identifiers) of the connected nodes, as well as the name of the link, are mentioned.

Then the export data follows, where the data appears "grouped" into entity types.
It is worth noticing the references between the instances of the various entities.
For example the DbNode with identifier *5921143* belongs to the user with identifier 2 and was generated by the computer with identifier 1.

The name of the entities is a reference to the base ORM entities.
This ensuries that the export files are cross-backend compatible.

If any groups are extracted, then they are mentioned in the corresponding field (*groups_uuid*).

Attributes and extras of the extracted nodes, are described in the final part of the JSON file.
The identifier of the corresponding node is used as a key for the attribute or extra.


Export Archive Migration
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Old AiiDA archives may be migrated to the newest version using ``verdi export migrate``, in order to make them importable into the newest AiiDA version.

New export versions are introduced for several different reasons.
This may generally be when
* a change occurs in what can or cannot be exported for each entity,
* the schemes in ``metadata.json`` are updated or changed,
* or standardized exported property values (like the one for ``node_type`` or similar) are updated in AiiDA.

As a default, ``verdi import`` will call ``verdi export migrate`` if an old archive is supplied.

.. note::

    It is not possible to "downgrade" an archive to previous export versions.
    However, since the migration will produce a new file, you will have your archive in at least two different export versions.

.. note::

    For archives of version 0.3 and older (run either ``verdi export inspect -v <ARCHIVE>`` or inspect your ``metadata.json`` file directly to check the version), it is advisable that you manually try to convince yourself that the migration was completely successful.
    While all migrations are tested, trying to include reasonable edge-cases, the migrations involed in going from version 0.3 to 0.4 are intricate and it is virtually impossible to account for all edge-cases that may occur.
    It is worth noting that if you ever have an issue, please report it on `GitHub <https://www.github.com/aiidateam/aiida_core/issues/new>`_, join the `AiiDA mailing list <http://www.aiida.net/mailing-list/>`_, or use the `contact form <http://www.aiida.net/contact-new/>`_.


Inspect Export Archives
+++++++++++++++++++++++

You can inspect an export archive by using ``verdi export inspect``.

This is useful to get a quick overview of the amount of different entities contained in the archive.
Furthermore, using the ``-v`` flag, you can quickly inspect the archive's export version.

Note that for archives with export versions prior to 0.3 (0.3 not included), the quick entities overview is not accurate.
Future updates to AiiDA and the export/import schemes may change the validity of other export versions.

#################################
Welcome to AiiDA's documentation!
#################################

`AiiDA`_ is a python framework that aims to help researchers with managing complex workflows and making them fully reproducible.

.. _AiiDA: http://www.aiida.net


************
Features
************

 * **Workflows:** Write complex, auto-documenting workflows in python, linked to arbitrary executables on local and remote computers. The event-based workflow engine supports tens of thousands of processes per hour with full checkpointing.
 * **Data provenance:** Automatically track inputs, outpus & metadata of all calculations in a provenance graph for full reproducibility. Perform fast queries on graphs containing millions of nodes.
 * **HPC interface:** Move your calculations to a different computer by changing one line of code. AiiDA is compatible with schedulers like `SLURM <https://slurm.schedmd.com>`_, `PBS Pro <https://www.pbspro.org/>`_, `torque <http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/products/torque/>`_, `SGE <http://gridscheduler.sourceforge.net/>`_ or `LSF <https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSETD4/product_welcome_platform_lsf.html>`_ out of the box.
 * **Plugin interface:** Extend AiiDA with `plugins <https://aiidateam.github.io/aiida-registry/>`_ for new simulation codes (input generation & parsing), data types, schedulers, transport modes and more.
 * **Open Science:** Export subsets of your provenance graph and share them with peers or make them available online for everyone on the `Materials Cloud <https://www.materialscloud.org>`_.
 * **Open source:** AiiDA is released under the `MIT open source license <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/blob/develop/LICENSE.txt>`_.

***************
Getting started
***************

 * The `AiiDA tutorials <https://aiida-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ are a good place to get started with using AiiDA.
 * Afterwards, you might want to :ref:`install AiiDA<installation>` on your machine.
 * For setting up a production environment, you may find the :ref:`configuration <configure_aiida>` section helpful.
 * For the advanced, there is the complete :doc:`AiiDA API reference<apidoc/aiida>` (including a :ref:`modindex`), and of course you can always peek into the code on the `AiiDA git repository <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core>`_.

**************
For developers
**************

 * If you wish to start developing a plugin for AiiDA the :ref:`plugin_development` section is a good place to start.
 * Practical information concerning how to set up your development environment and how to contribute to aiida core can be found on the `AiiDA Wiki <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/wiki>`_.
 * You are also more than welcome to join the `AiiDA mailing list <http://www.aiida.net/mailing-list/>`_ or contribute to aiida-core on `GitHub <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core>`_.

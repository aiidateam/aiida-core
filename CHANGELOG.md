- Fix bug in `verdi data` list commands for SQLAlchemy backend [[#1007]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida_core/pull/1007)

### Minor bug fixes
- Various bug fixes related to workflows for the SQLAlchemy backend [[#952]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida_core/pull/952) [[#960]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida_core/pull/960)


## v0.10.0:

### Major changes
- The `DbPath` table has been removed and replaced with a dynamic transitive closure, because, among others, nested workchains could lead to the `DbPath` table exploding in size
- Code plugins have been removed from `aiida_core` and have been migrated to their own respective plugin repositories and can be found here:
    * [Quantum ESPRESSO](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-quantumespresso)
    * [ASE](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-ase)
    * [COD tools](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-codtools)
    * [NWChem](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-nwchem)

    Each can be installed from `pip` using e.g. `pip install aiida-quantumespresso`.
    Existing installations will require a migration (see [update instructions in the documentation](https://aiida-core.readthedocs.io/en/v0.10.0/installation/updating.html#plugin-migration)).
    For a complete overview of available plugins you can visit [the registry](https://aiidateam.github.io/aiida-registry/).

- Improvement of command-line export functionality (more options, possibility to write directly to file, possibility to pass custom options to exporter, by removing its DbPath dependency)

### Workchains
- Crucial bug fix: workchains can now be run through the daemon, i.e. by using `aiida.work.submit`

## v0.7.0

This release introduces a lot and significant changes & enhancements.

We worked on our new backend and now AiiDA can be installed using SQLAlchemy too. Many of the verdi  
commands and functionalities have been tested and are working with this backend. The full JSON  
support provided by SQLAlchemy and the latest versions of PostgreSQL enable significant speed  
increase in attribute related queries. SQLAlchemy backend choice is a beta option since some last  
functionalities and commands need to be implemented or improved for this backend. Scripts are  
provided for the transition of databases from Django backend to SQLAlchemy backend.

In this release we have included a new querying tool called `QueryBuilder`. It is a powerfull tool  
allowing users to write complex graph queries to explore the AiiDA graph database. It provides  
various features like selection of entity properties, filtering of results, combination of entities  
on specific properties as well as various ways to obtain the final result. It also provides the  
users an abstract way to query their data without enforcing them to write backend dependent queries.

Last but not least we have included a new workflow engine (in beta version) which is available  
through the `verdi workflow2` command. The new workflows are easier to write (it is as close as  
writing python as possible), there is seamless mixing of short running tasks with long running  
(remote) tasks and they encourage users to write reusable workflows. Moreover, debugging of  
workflows has been made easier and it is possible both in-IDE and through logging.

### List of changes:
- Installation procedure works with SQLAlchemy backend too (SQLAlchemy option is still in beta).
- Most of the verdi commands work with SQLAlchemy backend.
- Transition script from Django schema of version 0.7.0 to SQLAlchemy schema of version 0.7.0.
- AiiDA daemon redesigned and working with both backends (Django & SQLAlchemy).
- Introducing new workflow engine that allows better debugging and easier to write workflows. It is  
available under the `verdi workflows2` command. Examples are also added.
- Old workflows are still supported and available under the "verdi workflow" command.
- Introducing new querying tool (called `QueryBuilder`). It allows to easily write complex graph  
queries that will be executed on the AiiDA graph database. Extensive documentation also added.
- Unifying behaviour of verdi commands in both backends.
- Upped to version 0.4.2 of plum (needed for workflows2)
- Implemented the validator and input helper for Quantum ESPRESSO pw.x.
- Improved the documentation for the pw (and cp) input plugins (for all the flags in the Settings  
node).
- Fixed a wrong behavior in the QE pw/cp plugins when checking for the parser options and checking  
if there were further unknown flags in the Settings node. However, this does not solve yet  
completely the problem (see issue #219).
- Implemented validator and input helper for Quantum ESPRESSO pw.x.
- Added elements with Z=104-112, 114 and 116, in `aiida.common.constants`.
- Added method `set_kpoints_mesh_from_density` in `KpointsData` class.
- Improved incremental backup documentation.
- Added backup related tests.
- Added an option to `test_pw.py` to run also in serial.
- SSH transport, to connect to remote computers via SSH/SFTP.
- Support for the SGE and SLURM schedulers.
- Support for Quantum ESPRESSO Car-Parrinello calculations.
- Support for data nodes to store electronic bands, phonon dispersion and generally arrays defined  
over the Brillouin zone.


## v0.6.0

We performed a lot of changes to introduce in one of our following releases a second  
object-relational mapper (we will refer to it as back-end) for the management of the used DBMSs and  
more specifically of PostgreSQL. SQLAlchemy and the latest version of PostgreSQL allows AiiDA to  
store JSON documents directly to the database and also to query them. Moreover the JSON query  
optimization is left to the database including also the use of the JSON specific indexes. There was  
major code restructuring to accommodate the new back-end resulting to abstracting many classes of  
the orm package of AiiDA.

Even if most of the needed restructuring & code addition has been finished, a bit of more work is  
needed. Therefore even in this version, Django is the only available back-end for the end user.

However, the users have to update their AiiDA configuration files by executing the migration file  
that can be found at `YOUR_AIIDA_DIR/aiida/common/additions/migration.py` as the Linux user that  
installed AiiDA in your system.
(e.g. `python YOUR_AIIDA_DIR/aiida/common/additions/migration.py`)

### List of changes:
- Back-end selection (Added backend selection). SQLAlchemy selection is disabled for the moment.
- Migration scripts for the configuration files of AiiDA (SQLAlchemy support).
- Enriched link description in the database (to enrich the provenance model).
- Corrections for numpy array and cell. List will be used with cell.
- Fixed backend import. Verdi commands load as late as possible the needed backend.
- Abstraction of the basic AiiDA orm classes (like node, computer, data etc). This is needed to  
support different backends (e.g. Django and SQLAlchemy).
- Fixes on the structure import from QE-input files.
- SQLAlchemy and Django benchmarks.
- UltraJSON support.
- requirements.txt now also include SQLAlchemy and its dependencies.
- Recursive way of loading JSON for SQLAlchemy.
- Improved way of accessing calculations and workflows attached to a workflow step.
- Added methods to programmatically create new codes and computers.

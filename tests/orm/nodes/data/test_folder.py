    During the reorganization of the ``Node`` interface, the repository methods were moved to the ``base.repository``
    namespace and deprecation warnings would be printed when the repository interface would be called directly from the
    top-level namespace. The change was corrected for the ``FolderData`` since for that data type the repository API
    _should_ be the direct interface, and users should not have to go down the ``.base.repository`` namespace. Here we
    test that no deprecation warnings are emitted for the public API. Once the deprecation warnings are removed in
    AiiDA v3.0, this test can also be removed.

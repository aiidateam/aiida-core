# Important: we need to disable all unneeded formats.
# Note that HTML and JSON are always built: https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/yaml-config.html#formats
# Especially, the 'htmlzip' format takes a LOT of memory and causes the build to fail - see our issue #1472:

# Need to install the package itself such that the entry points are installed and the API doc can build properly

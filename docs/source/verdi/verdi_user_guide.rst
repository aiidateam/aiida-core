The ``verdi`` commands
######################

For some the most common operations on the AiiDA software, you can work directly
on the command line using the set of ``verdi`` commands.
You already used the ``verdi install`` when installing the software.
There are quite some more functionalities attached to this command, here's a
list:

* **calculation**:         query and interact with calculations
* **code**:                setup and manage codes to be used
* **comment**:             manage general properties of nodes in the database
* **completioncommand**:   return the bash completion function to put in ~/.bashrc
* **computer**:            setup and manage computers to be used
* **daemon**:              manage the AiiDA daemon
* **data**:                setup and manage data specific types
* **devel**:               AiiDA commands for developers
* **export**:              export nodes and group of nodes
* **gotocomputer**:        open a shell to the calc folder on the cluster
* **group**:               setup and manage groups
* **import**:              export nodes and group of nodes
* **install**:             install/setup aiida for the current user
* **runserver**:           run the AiiDA webserver on localhost
* **shell**:               run the interactive shell with the Django environment
* **user**:                list and configure new AiiDA users.
* **workflow**:            manage the AiiDA worflow manager


Following below, a list with the subcommands available.

``verdi calculation``
+++++++++++++++++++++

  * **kill**: stop the execution on the cluster of a calculation.
  * **logshow**: shows the logs/errors produced by a calculation
  * **plugins**: lists the supported calculation plugins
  * **list**: list the AiiDA calculations. By default, lists only the running 
    calculations.
  * **show**: shows the database information related to the calculation: 
    used code, all the input nodes and all the output nodes. 


``verdi code``
++++++++++++++

  *  **show**: shows the information of the installed code.
  *  **list**: lists the installed codes
  *  **setup**: setup a new code
  *  **relabel**: change the label (name) of a code. If you like to load codes 
     based on their labels and not on their UUID's or PK's, take care of using
     unique labels!
  *  **update**: change (some of) the installation description of the code given
     at the moment of the setup. 
  *  **delete**: delete a code from the database. Only possible for disconnected 
     codes (i.e. a code that has not been used yet)


``verdi comment``
+++++++++++++++++
Manages the comments attached to a database node.

  *  **add**: add a new comment
  *  **update**: change an existing comment
  *  **remove**: remove a comment
  *  **show**: show the comments attached to a node.


``verdi completioncommand``
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Prints the string to be copied and pasted to the bahrc in order to allow for
autocompletion of the verdi commands.

``verdi computer``
++++++++++++++++++

  *  **setup**: creates a new computer object
  *  **configure**: set up some extra info that can be used in the connection
     with that computer.
  *  **enable**: to enable a computer. If the computer is disabled, the daemon 
     will not try to connect to the computer, so it will not retrieve or launch 
     calculations. Useful if a computer is under mantainance. 
  *  **rename**: changes the name of a computer.
  *  **disable**: disable a computer (see enable for a larger description)
  *  **show**: shows the details of an installed computer
  *  **list**: list all installed computers
  *  **delete**: deletes a computer node. Works only if the computer node is 
     a disconnected node in the database (has not been used yet)
  *  **test**: tests if the current user (or a given user) can connect to the
     computer and if basic operations perform as expected (file copy, getting
     the list of jobs in the scheduler queue, ...)

``verdi daemon``
++++++++++++++++
Manages the daemon, i.e. the process that runs in background and that manages 
submission/retrieval of calculations.

  *  **status**: see the status of the daemon. Typically, it will either show
     ``Daemon not running`` or you will see two
     processes with state ``RUNNING``.
    
  *  **stop**: stops the daemon
  
  *  **configureuser**: sets the user which is running the daemon. See the 
     installation guide for more details.
     
  *  **start**: starts the daemon.
  
  *  **logshow**: show the last lines of the daemon log (use for debugging)
  
  *  **restart**: restarts the daemon.
  
  
``verdi data``
++++++++++++++
Manages database data objects.

  *  **upf**: handles the Pseudopotential Datas
  
    * **listfamilies**: list presently stored families of pseudopotentials
    
    * **uploadfamily**: install a new family (group) of pseudopotentials
  
  *  **structure**: handles the StructureData 
  
    * **list**: list currently saved nodes of StructureData kind
    
    * **show**: use a third-party visualizer (like vmd or xcrysden) 
      to graphically show the StructureData


``verdi devel``
+++++++++++++++

Here there are some functions that are in the development stage, and that might 
eventually find their way outside of this placeholder.
As such, they are buggy, possibly difficult to use, not necessarily documented,
and they might be subject to non back-compatible changes.


``verdi export``
++++++++++++++++

Export data from the AiiDA database to a file. 
See also ``verdi import`` to import this data on another database.

``verdi gotocomputer``
++++++++++++++++++++++

Opens a new connection to the computer (either simply a bash shell
or a ssh connection, depending on the transport) and directly
change directory to the appropriate folder where the code is
running.

.. note:: Be careful not to change any file that AiiDA created,
  nor to modify the output files or resubmit the calculation, 
  unless you **really** know what you are doing, 
  otherwise AiiDA may get very confused!   

``verdi group``
+++++++++++++++

  *  **list**: list all the groups in the database.

``verdi import``
++++++++++++++++

Imports data (coming from other AiiDA databases) in the current database 

``verdi install``
+++++++++++++++++

Used in the installation to configure the database.
If it finds an already installed database, it updates the tables migrating them 
to the new schema.

``verdi runserver``
+++++++++++++++++++

Starts a lightweight Web server for development and also serves static files.
Currently in ongoing development.

``verdi shell``
+++++++++++++++

Runs a Python interactive interpreter. 
Tries to use IPython or bpython, if one of them is available.
Loads on start a good part of the AiiDA infrastructure.

``verdi user``
++++++++++++++
Manages the AiiDA users. Two valid subcommands.

  *  **list**: list existing users configured for your AiiDA installation.
  *  **configure**: configure a new AiiDA user.

``verdi workflow``
++++++++++++++++++
Manages the workflow. Valid subcommands:

  * **report**: display the information on how the workflow is evolving.
  * **kill**: kills a workflow.
  * **list**: lists the workflows present in the database. 
    By default, shows only the running ones.

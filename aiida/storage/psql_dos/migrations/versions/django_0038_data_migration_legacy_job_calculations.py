"""Migrate legacy `JobCalculations`.

These old nodes have already been migrated to the correct `CalcJobNode` type in a previous migration, but they can
still contain a `state` attribute with a deprecated `JobCalcState` value and they are missing a value for the
`process_state`, `process_status`, `process_label` and `exit_status`. The `process_label` is impossible to infer
consistently in SQL so it will be omitted. The other  will be mapped from the `state` attribute as follows:

.. code-block:: text

    Old state            | Process state  | Exit status | Process status
    ---------------------|----------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------
    `NEW`                | `Killed`       |    `None`   | Legacy `JobCalculation` with state `NEW`
    `TOSUBMIT`           | `Killed`       |    `None`   | Legacy `JobCalculation` with state `TOSUBMIT`
    `SUBMITTING`         | `Killed`       |    `None`   | Legacy `JobCalculation` with state `SUBMITTING`
    `WITHSCHEDULER`      | `Killed`       |    `None`   | Legacy `JobCalculation` with state `WITHSCHEDULER`
    `COMPUTED`           | `Killed`       |    `None`   | Legacy `JobCalculation` with state `COMPUTED`
    `RETRIEVING`         | `Killed`       |    `None`   | Legacy `JobCalculation` with state `RETRIEVING`
    `PARSING`            | `Killed`       |    `None`   | Legacy `JobCalculation` with state `PARSING`
    `SUBMISSIONFAILED`   | `Excepted`     |    `None`   | Legacy `JobCalculation` with state `SUBMISSIONFAILED`
    `RETRIEVALFAILED`    | `Excepted`     |    `None`   | Legacy `JobCalculation` with state `RETRIEVALFAILED`
    `PARSINGFAILED`      | `Excepted`     |    `None`   | Legacy `JobCalculation` with state `PARSINGFAILED`
    `FAILED`             | `Finished`     |      2      |  -
    `FINISHED`           | `Finished`     |      0      |  -
    `IMPORTED`           |       -        |      -      |  -


Note the `IMPORTED` state was never actually stored in the `state` attribute, so we do not have to consider it.
The old `state` attribute has to be removed after the data is migrated, because its value is no longer valid or useful.

Note: in addition to the three attributes mentioned in the table, all matched nodes will get `Legacy JobCalculation` as
their `process_label` which is one of the default columns of `verdi process list`.

This migration is identical to 26d561acd560

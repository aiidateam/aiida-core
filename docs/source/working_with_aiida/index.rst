Command line interface
======================

One way of interacting with AiiDA is through the ``verdi`` command line interface (CLI).

Before checking out the individual commands below, start with a brief look at the :ref:`general concepts<cli_concepts>` that apply across all commands.

=========
Scripting
=========

While the ``verdi`` CLI provides shortcuts for many common tasks, the AiiDA python API provides full access to the underlying AiiDA python objects and their methods.
This is possible via the interactive ``verdi shell`` and via python scripts:

==========
Schedulers
==========

As described in the section about calculations, ``CalcJobNode`` instances are submitted by the daemon to an external scheduler.
For this functionality to work, AiiDA needs to be able to interact with these schedulers.
Interfaces have been written for some of the most used schedulers.

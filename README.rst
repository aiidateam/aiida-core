**Automated Interactive Infrastructure and Database for Computational Science**

AiiDA is a sophisticated framework designed from scratch to be a flexible
and scalable infrastructure for atomistic simulations. Being able to store
the full data provenance of each simulation, and based on a tailored
database solution built for efficient data mining implementations,
AiiDA gives the user the ability to interact seamlessly with any
number of HPC machines and codes thanks to its flexible plugin
interface, together with a powerful workflow engine for the automation 
of simulations.

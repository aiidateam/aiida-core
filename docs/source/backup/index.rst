how to move it to a different location and how to backup your repository.


.. _backup_postgresql:

Create database backup
++++++++++++++++++++++

It is strongly advised to backup the content of your database daily. Below are
instructions to set this up for the PostgreSQL database, under Ubuntu
(tested with version 12.04).

.. note:: Perform the following operation after having set up AiiDA. Only then
  the ``~/.aiida`` folder (and the files within) will be created.

The database files are not put in the ``.aiida`` folder but in the system directories
which typically are not backed up. Moreover, the database is spread over lots of files
that, if backed up as they are at a given time, cannot be re-used to restore the database.

So you need to periodically (typically once a day) dump the database contents in a file
that will be backed up.
This can be done by the following bash script
:download:`backup_postgresql.sh<backup_postgresql.sh>`::

	#!/bin/bash
	AIIDAUSER=aiida
	AIIDADB=aiidadb
	AIIDAPORT=5432
	## STORE THE PASSWORD, IN THE PROPER FORMAT, IN THE ~/.pgpass file
	## see http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-pgpass.html
	AIIDALOCALTMPDUMPFILE=~/.aiida/${AIIDADB}-backup.psql.gz


	if [ -e ${AIIDALOCALTMPDUMPFILE} ]
	then
	    mv ${AIIDALOCALTMPDUMPFILE} ${AIIDALOCALTMPDUMPFILE}~
	fi

	# NOTE: password stored in ~/.pgpass, where pg_dump will read it automatically
	pg_dump -h localhost -p $AIIDAPORT -U $AIIDAUSER $AIIDADB | gzip > $AIIDALOCALTMPDUMPFILE || rm $AIIDALOCALTMPDUMPFILE


Before launching the script you need to create the file ``~/.pgpass`` to avoid having to enter your database
password each time you use the script. It should look like (:download:`.pgpass<pgpass>`)::

    localhost:5432:aiidadb:aiida:YOUR_DATABASE_PASSWORD

where ``YOUR_DATABASE_PASSWORD`` is the password you set up for the database.

.. note:: Do not forget to put this file in ~/ and to name it ``.pgpass``.
   Remember also to give it the right permissions (read and write): ``chmod u=rw .pgpass``.

To dump the database in a file automatically everyday, you can add the following script
:download:`backup-aiidadb-USERNAME<backup-aiidadb-USERNAME>` in ``/etc/cron.daily/``, which will
launch the previous script once per day::

    #!/bin/bash
    su USERNAME -c "/home/USERNAME/.aiida/backup_postgresql.sh"

where all instances of ``USERNAME`` are replaced by your actual user name. The ``su USERNAME``
makes the dumped file be owned by you rather than by ``root``.
Remember to give the script the right permissions::

  sudo chmod +x /etc/cron.daily/backup-aiidadb-USERNAME

Finally make sure your database folder (``/home/USERNAME/.aiida/``) containing this dump file
and the ``repository`` directory, is properly backed up by
your backup software (under Ubuntu, Backup -> check the "Folders" tab).

.. note:: If your database is very large (more than a few hundreds of thousands 
  of nodes and workflows), a standard backup of your repository folder will be
  very slow (up to days), thus slowing down your computer dramatically. To fix
  this problem you can set up an incremental backup of your repository by following
  the instructions :ref:`here<repository_backup>`.


Restore database backup
+++++++++++++++++++++++

In order to retrieve the database from a backup, you have first to
create a empty database following the instructions described above in
"Setup instructions: PostgreSQL" except the ``verdi install``
phase. Once that you have created your empty database with the same
names of the backuped one, type the following command::

    psql -h localhost -U aiida -d aiidadb -f aiidadb-backup.psql


.. _move_postgresql:

Move database
+++++++++++++

It might happen that you need to move the physical location of the database
files on your hard-drive (for instance, due to the lack of space in the
partition where it is located). Below we explain how to do it.

First, make sure you have a backup of the full database (see instructions
:ref:`here<backup_postgresql>`), and that the AiiDA daemon is not running.
Then, become the UNIX ``postgres`` user, typing as root::

  su - postgres

(or, equivalently, type ``sudo su - postgres``, depending on your distribution).

Then enter the postgres shell::

  psql

and look for the current location of the data directory::

  SHOW data_directory;

Typically you should get something like ``/var/lib/postgresql/9.1/main``.

.. note :: In the above, ``9.1`` is replaced by the actual version number of your postgres distribution (the same applies to the remainder of the section).

.. note :: If you are experiencing memory problems and cannot enter the postgres
	shell, you can look directly into the file ``/etc/postgresql/9.1/main/postgresql.conf``
	and check out the line defining the variable ``data_directory``.

Then exit the shell with ``\q``, and stop the postgres database daemon::

  service postgresql stop

Copy all the files and folders from the postgres data directory into the new directory::

  cp -a SOURCE_DIRECTORY DESTINATION_DIRECTORY

where ``SOURCE_DIRECTORY`` is the directory you got from the
``SHOW data_directory;`` command, and ``DESTINATION_DIRECTORY`` is the new
directory for the database files.

.. note :: The behaviour of the ``cp -a`` command is to create a directory into ``DESTINATION_DIRECTORY``, e.g.::

    cp -a OLD_DIR/main/ NEW_DIR/

  will create the directory ``main`` into ``NEW_DIR``.

Make sure the permissions, owner and group are the same in the old and new directory
(including all levels above the ``DESTINATION_DIRECTORY``). The owner and group
should be both ``postgres``, at the notable exception of some symbolic links in
``server.crt`` and ``server.key`` (these files might be absent, depending on your postgresql version number).

.. note :: If the permissions of these links need to be changed, use the ``-h``
  option of ``chown`` to avoid changing the permissions of the destination of the
  links. In case you have changed the permission of the links destination by
  mistake, they should typically be (beware that this might depend on your
  actual distribution!)::

    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 989 Mar  1  2012 /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
    -rw-r----- 1 root ssl-cert 1704 Mar  1  2012 /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key

Then you can change the postgres configuration file, that should typically
be located here::

   /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/postgresql.conf

Make a backup version of this file, then look for the line defining
``data_directory`` and replace it with the new data directory path::

   data_directory = 'NEW_DATA_DIRECTORY'

Then start again the database daemon::

  service postgresql start

You can check that the data directory has indeed changed::

  psql
  SHOW data_directory;
  \q

Before removing definitely the previous location of the database files,
first rename it and test AiiDA with the new database location (e.g. do simple
queries like ``verdi code list`` or create a node and store it). If
everything went fine, you can delete the old database location.


.. _repository_backup:

Setup repository backup
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Apart from the database backup, you should also backup the AiiDA repository.
For small repositories, this can be easily done by a simple directory copy or,
even better, with the use of the rsync command which can copy only the differences.
However, both of the aforementioned approaches are not efficient in big
repositories where even a partial recursive directory listing may take
significant time, especially for filesystems where accessing a directory has
a constant (and significant) latency time. Therefore, we provide scripts for
making efficient backups of the AiiDA repository.

Before running the backup script, you will have to configure it. Therefore you
should execute the ``backup_setup.py`` which is located under
``MY_AIIDA_FOLDER/aiida/manage/backup``. For example::

	verdi -p PROFILENAME run MY_AIIDA_FOLDER/aiida/manage/backup/backup_setup.py

where PROFILENAME is the name of the profile you want to use (if you don't specify the ``-p`` option, the default profile will be used). This will ask a set of questions. More precisely, it will initially ask for:

 * The backup folder. This is the destination of the backup *configuration file*.
   By default a folder named ``backup`` in your ``.aiida`` directory is
   proposed to be created.

 * The destination folder of the backup. This is the destination folder of the
   files to be backed up. By default it is a folder inside the aforementioned
   ``backup`` folder (e.g. ``/home/aiida_user/.aiida/backup/backup_dest``).

.. note:: You should backup the repository on a different disk than the one in
  which you have the AiiDA repository! If you just use the same disk, you don't
  have any security against the most common data loss cause: disk failure.
  The best option is to use a destination folder mounted over ssh. For this 
  you need to install ``sshfs`` (under ubuntu: ``sudo apt-get install sshfs``).

  E.g. Imagine that you run your calculations on server_1 and you would like to
  take regular repository backups to server_2. Then, you could mount a server_2
  directory via sshfs on server_1 using the following command on server_1:

  ``sshfs -o idmap=user -o rw backup_user@server_2:/home/backup_user/backup_destination_dir/``
  ``/home/aiida_user/remote_backup_dir/``
  
  You should put this line into the actions performed at start-up (under gnome you 
  can access them by typing ``gnome-session-properties`` in a terminal), so that the 
  remote directory is mounted automatically after a reboot.
  Do **not** put it in your shell's startup file (e.g. ``.bashrc``) -
  otherwise each time you open a new terminal, your computer will complain that
  the mount point is not empty... 


A template backup configuration file (``backup_info.json.tmpl``) will be copied
in the backup folder. You can set the backup variables by yourself after renaming
the template file to ``backup_info.json``, or you can answer the questions asked
by the script, and then ``backup_info.json`` will be created based on you answers.

The main script backs up the AiiDA repository that is referenced by the current
AiiDA database. The script will start from the ``oldest_object_backedup`` date
or the date of the oldest node/workflow object found and it will periodically
backup (in periods of ``periodicity`` days) until the ending date of the backup
specified by ``end_date_of_backup`` or ``days_to_backup``

The backup parameters to be set in the ``backup_info.json`` are:

 * ``periodicity`` (in days): The backup runs periodically for a number of days
   defined in the periodicity variable. The purpose of this variable is to limit
   the backup to run only on a few number of days and therefore to limit the
   number of files that are backed up at every round. e.g. ``"periodicity": 2``
   Example: if you have files in the AiiDA repositories created in the past 30
   days, and periodicity is 15, the first run will backup the files of the first
   15 days; a second run of the script will backup the next 15 days, completing
   the backup (if it is run within the same day). Further runs will only backup
   newer files, if they are created.

 * ``oldest_object_backedup`` (timestamp or null): This is the timestamp of the
   oldest object that was backed up. If you are not aware of this value or if it
   is the first time that you start a backup up for this repository, then set
   this value to ``null``. Then the script will search the creation date of the
   oldest workflow or node object in the database and it will start
   the backup from that date. E.g. ``"oldest_object_backedup": "2015-07-20 11:13:08.145804+02:00"``

 * ``end_date_of_backup``: If set, the backup script will backup files that
   have a modification date until the value specified by this variable. If not set,
   the ending of the backup will be set by the following variable
   (``days_to_backup``) which specifies how many days to backup from the start
   of the backup. If none of these variables are set (``end_date_of_backup``
   and ``days_to_backup``), then the end date of backup is set to the current date.
   E.g. ``"end_date_of_backup": null`` or ``"end_date_of_backup": "2015-07-20 11:13:08.145804+02:00"``


 * ``days_to_backup``: If set, you specify how many days you will backup from the starting date
   of your backup. If it set to ``null`` and also
   ``end_date_of_backup`` is set to ``null``, then the end date of the backup is set
   to the current date. You can not set ``days_to_backup`` & ``end_date_of_backup``
   at the same time (it will lead to an error). E.g. ``"days_to_backup": null``
   or ``"days_to_backup": 5``

 * ``backup_length_threshold`` (in hours): The backup script runs in rounds and
   on every round it backs-up a number of days that are controlled primarily by
   ``periodicity`` and also by ``end_date_of_backup`` / ``days_to_backup``,
   for the last backup round. The ``backup_length_threshold`` specifies the
   lowest acceptable round length. This is important for the end of the backup.

 * ``backup_dir``: The destination directory of the backup. e.g.
   ``"backup_dir": "/home/aiida_user/.aiida/backup/backup_dest"``

To start the backup, run the ``start_backup.py`` script. Run as often as needed to complete a
full backup, and then run it periodically (e.g. calling it from a cron script, for instance every
day) to backup new changes.

.. note:: You can set up a cron job using the following command::

    sudo crontab -u aiida_user -e
  
  It will open an editor where you can add a line of the form::
  
    00 03 * * * /home/aiida_user/.aiida/backup/start_backup.py 2>&1 | mail -s "Incremental backup of the repository" aiida_user_email@domain.net

  or (if you need to backup a different profile than the default one)::

    00 03 * * * verdi -p PROFILENAME run /home/aiida_user/.aiida/backup/start_backup.py 2>&1 | mail -s "Incremental backup of the repository" aiida_user_email@domain.net

  This will launch the backup of the database every day at 3 AM, and send the output
  (or any error message) to the email address of the user (provided the ``mail``
  command -- from ``mailutils`` -- is configured appropriately).
  
Finally, do not forget to exclude the repository folder from the normal backup 
of your home directory!

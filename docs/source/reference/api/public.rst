Overview of public API
----------------------

The main package of ``aiida-core`` is called ``aiida``, which contains various sub-packages that we refer to as "second-level packages".
These second level packages can have further nested hierarchies.
Certain resources within these packages, for example modules, classes, functions and variables, are intended for internal use, whereas others *are meant* to be used by users of the ``aiida-core`` package.
To make it easier for users to locate these resources that are intended for external use, as well as to distinguish them from internal resources *that are not supposed to be used*, they are exposed directly on the second-level package.
This means that any resource that can be directly imported from a second-level package, *is intended for external use*.
Below we provide a list of the resources per second-level package that are exposed in this way.
If a module is mentioned, then all the resources defined in its ``__all__`` are included

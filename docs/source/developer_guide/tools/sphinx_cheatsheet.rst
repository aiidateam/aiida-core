Sphinx cheatsheet
#################

A collection of some Sphinx features used in the AiiDA documentation.

Terminal and Code Formatting
============================

Something to be run in the command line can be formatted like this::

  Some command


Code formatting, but now with python syntax highlighting::

   import module
   print('hello world')

Another way of explicitly doing this is:

.. code-block:: python

  import module
  print('Hello, world!')

`Here <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/latest/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#directive-code-block>`_ is an external link to the Sphinx doc on this.
Note also the keyword ``highlight`` (`Sphinx documentation here <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/latest/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#directive-highlight>`_), which may also be used to achieve a similar result.

Notes
=====

.. note:: Notes can be added like this.

.. note::

  A multi-line note can be added like this.
  Hello, world!


Links, Code Display, Cross References
-------------------------------------

Code Download
=============

Code can be downloaded like this.

Download: :download:`this example script <../../concepts/include/snippets/calculations/calcfunctions/add_multiply_plain_python.py>`

Code Display
============

Can be done like this.
This entire document can be seen unformatted at :ref:`this-page` using the keyword ``literalinclude``.
For more details, see the `Sphinx documentation <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/latest/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#directive-literalinclude>`_.

.. literalinclude:: ../../concepts/include/snippets/calculations/calcfunctions/add_multiply_plain_python.py

.. _self-reference:

Math
====

Math formulas can be added as follows :math:`<g_i|`, see `the Sphinx documentation on math <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/latest/ext/math.html#module-sphinx.ext.mathbase>`_.

Cross Reference Docs
====================

Here is an example of a reference to :ref:`structure_tutorial` which is on *another page*.

Here, :ref:`self-reference`, is an example of a reference to something on the same page.

.. note:: References within the same document need a reference label, see `.. _self-reference:` used in this section for an example.

Cross Reference Classes and Methods
===================================

Reference to the :py:class:`aiida.orm.nodes.data.structure.StructureData` class, showing the full path.

Reference to the :py:class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.data.structure.StructureData` class (with preceding tilde), showing only the class name.

.. note:: Always point to the actual definition of a class, e.g. ``aiida.orm.nodes.data.structure.StructureData``, **not** an alias like ``aiida.orm.StructureData`` (or Sphinx will complain).

Reference to the :py:meth:`~aiida.orm.nodes.data.structure.StructureData.append_atom` method.

Reference to the :py:attr:`~aiida.orm.nodes.Node.label` attribute/property.


Table of Contents for Code
==========================

Table of contents that cross reference code, can be done very similarly to how it is done for documents.
For example the parser docs can be indexed like this:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   aiida.orm <../../apidoc/aiida.orm>


Automodules Example
====================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

.. automodule:: aiida.common.warnings
   :members:
   :noindex:

.. note:: A ``:noindex:`` directive was added to avoid duplicate object description for this example.

How To Format Docstrings
------------------------

Much of the work will be done automatically by Sphinx, just format the docstrings with the same syntax used here, a few extra examples of use would include:

.. code-block:: python

    def some_function(parameter_name, other_parameter):
        """Some function
        Description of the purpose of this function

        :param parameter_name: some notes on input parameter 'parameter_name'
        :type parameter_name: str

        :param other_parameter: some notes on input parameter 'other_parameter'
        :type other_parameter: str,list

        :return returned_parameter: some note on what is returned
        :rtype: str

        :raise TypeError: notes on when and why TypeError is raised
        :raise `~aiida.common.exceptions.IntegrationError`: Notes on when and why IntegrationError is raised
        """

        # function code here

In the docstring of a class, you can `refer to a method of the same class <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/domains.html>`_ using ``:meth:`.name_of_method```.

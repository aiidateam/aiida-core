    :param delay: How long to sleep (seconds) before collecting the memory dump.
        This is a convenience function for tests involving Processes. For example, :py:func:`~aiida.engine.run` returns
        before all futures are resolved/cleaned up. Dumping memory too early would catch those and the references they
        carry, although they may not actually be leaking memory.

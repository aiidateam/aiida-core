To create a new profile with full control over its configuration, please use `verdi profile setup` instead.

It automatically checks for RabbitMQ running on the localhost, and, if it can connect, configures that as the broker for the profile. Otherwise, the profile is created without a broker, in which case some functionality will be unavailable, most notably running the daemon and submitting processes to said daemon.

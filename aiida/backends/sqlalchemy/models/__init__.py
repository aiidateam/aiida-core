# This variable identifies the schema version of this file.
# Every time you change the schema below in *ANY* way, REMEMBER TO CHANGE
# the version here in the migration file and update migrations/__init__.py.
# See the documentation for how to do all this.
#
# The version is checked at code load time to verify that the code schema
# version and the DB schema version are the same. (The DB schema version
# is stored in the DbSetting table and the check is done in the
# load_dbenv() function).

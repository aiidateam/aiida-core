"""Class that defines the abstract interface for an object repository.

The scope of this class is intentionally very narrow. Any backend implementation should merely provide the methods to
store binary blobs, or "objects", and return a string-based key that unique identifies the object that was just created.
This key should then be able to be used to retrieve the bytes of the corresponding object or to delete it.

    The repository backend only deals with raw bytes, both when creating new objects as well as when returning a stream
    or the content of an existing object. The encoding and decoding of the byte content should be done by the client
    upstream. The file repository backend is also not expected to keep any kind of file hierarchy but must be assumed
    to be a simple flat data store. When files are created in the file object repository, the implementation will return
    a string-based key with which the content of the stored object can be addressed. This key is guaranteed to be unique
    and persistent. Persisting the key or mapping it onto a virtual file hierarchy is again up to the client upstream.

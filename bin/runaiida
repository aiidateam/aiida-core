#!/bin/bash
# Pass all parameters to 'verdi run'
# This is useful to use in a shebang line: i.e., you can put
# the following line as the first line in a file:

#!/usr/bin/env runaiida

# and the script will be run with 'verdi run' upon execution
# (if it has the correct execution bits set, i.e. using
# chmod +x ...)

# With "$@", each parameter is correctly escaped
verdi run "$@"

    """`Data` sub class to represent a dictionary.

    The dictionary contents of a `Dict` node are stored in the database as attributes. The dictionary
    can be initialized through the `dict` argument in the constructor. After construction, values can
    be retrieved and updated through the item getters and setters, respectively:

        node['key'] = 'value'

    Alternatively, the `dict` property returns an instance of the `AttributeManager` that can be used
    to get and set values through attribute notation:

        node.dict.key = 'value'

    Note that trying to set dictionary values directly on the node, e.g. `node.key = value`, will not
    work as intended. It will merely set the `key` attribute on the node instance, but will not be
    stored in the database. As soon as the node goes out of scope, the value will be lost.

    It is also relevant to note here the difference in something being an "attribute of a node" (in
    the sense that it is stored in the "attribute" column of the database when the node is stored)
    and something being an "attribute of a python object" (in the sense of being able to modify and
    access it as if it was a property of the variable, e.g. `node.key = value`). This is true of all
    types of nodes, but it becomes more relevant for `Dict` nodes where one is constantly manipulating
    these attributes.

    Finally, all dictionary mutations will be forbidden once the node is stored.

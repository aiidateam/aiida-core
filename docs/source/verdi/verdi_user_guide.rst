The ``verdi`` commands
######################

For some of the most common operations in AiiDA, you can work directly from the command line using the a set of ``verdi`` commands. You already used ``verdi install`` when installing the software. There are quite some more functionalities attached to this command; here's a list:

* :ref:`calculation<calculation>`:				query and interact with calculations
* :ref:`code<code>`:                			setup and manage codes to be used
* :ref:`comment<comment>`:          			manage general properties of nodes in the database
* :ref:`completioncommand<completioncommand>`:	return the bash completion function to put in ~/.bashrc
* :ref:`computer<computer>`:            		setup and manage computers to be used
* :ref:`daemon<daemon>`:              			manage the AiiDA daemon
* :ref:`data<data>`:                			setup and manage data specific types
* :ref:`devel<devel>`:               			AiiDA commands for developers
* :ref:`export<export>`:              			export nodes and group of nodes
* :ref:`graph<graph>`:                    create a graph from a given root node
* :ref:`group<group>`:               			setup and manage groups
* :ref:`import<import>`:              			export nodes and group of nodes
* :ref:`install<install>`:             			install/setup aiida for the current user/create a new profile
* :ref:`node<node>`:                			manage operations on AiiDA nodes
* :ref:`profile<profile>`:                		list and manage AiiDA profiles
* :ref:`run<run>`:                  			execute an AiiDA script
* :ref:`shell<shell>`:               			run the interactive shell with the Django environment
* :ref:`user<user>`:                			list and configure new AiiDA users.
* :ref:`workflow<workflow>`:            		manage the AiiDA worflow manager


Each command above can be preceded by the ``-p <profile>`` or ``--profile=<profile>``
option, as in::
  
  verdi -p <profile> calculation list

This allows to select a specific AiiDA profile, and therefore a specific database,
on which the command is executed. Thus several databases can be handled and 
accessed simultaneously by AiiDA. To install a new profile, use the 
:ref:`install<install>` command.

.. note:: This profile selection has no effect on the ``verdi daemon`` commands.

Some ambiguity might arise when a certain ``verdi`` subcommand manages both positional arguments and at least one option which accepts an unspecified number of arguments. Make sure you insert the separator ``--`` between the last optional argument and the first positional argument. As an example, instead of typing::

  verdi export -g group1 group2 group3 export.aiida

rather type::

  verdi export -g group1 group2 group3 -- export.aiida

 The previous command will export the nodes belonging to groups ``group1``, ``group2``, and ``group3`` (specified by the option ``-g``) into the file ``export.aiida``, which is taken as a positional argument.

Below is a list with all the available subcommands.

.. _calculation:

``verdi calculation``
+++++++++++++++++++++

  * **kill**: stop the execution on the cluster of a calculation.
  * **logshow**: shows the logs/errors produced by a calculation
  * **plugins**: lists the supported calculation plugins
  * **inputcat**: shows an input file of a calculation node.
  * **inputls**: shows the list of the input files of a calculation node.
  * **list**: list the AiiDA calculations. By default, lists only the running 
    calculations.
  * **outputcat**: shows an ouput file of a calculation node. 
  * **outputls**: shows the list of the output files of a calculation node.
  * **show**: shows the database information related to the calculation: 
    used code, all the input nodes and all the output nodes. 
  * **gotocomputer**: open a shell to the calc folder on the cluster
  * **label**: view / set the label of a calculation
  * **description**: view / set the description of a calculation
  * **res**: shows the calculation results (from calc.res).
  * **cleanworkdir**: cleans the work directory (remote folder) of AiiDA calculations


.. note:: When using gotocomputer, be careful not to change any file
  that AiiDA created,
  nor to modify the output files or resubmit the calculation, 
  unless you **really** know what you are doing, 
  otherwise AiiDA may get very confused!   


.. _code:

``verdi code``
++++++++++++++

  *  **show**: shows the information of the installed code.
  *  **list**: lists the installed codes
  *  **hide**: hide codes from `verdi code list`
  *  **reveal**: un-hide codes for `verdi code list`
  *  **setup**: setup a new code
  *  **rename**: change the label (name) of a code. If you like to load codes 
     based on their labels and not on their UUID's or PK's, take care of using
     unique labels!
  *  **update**: change (some of) the installation description of the code given
     at the moment of the setup. 
  *  **delete**: delete a code from the database. Only possible for disconnected 
     codes (i.e. a code that has not been used yet)


.. _comment:

``verdi comment``
+++++++++++++++++
There are various ways of attaching notes/comments to a node within AiiDA. In the first scripting examples, you might already have noticed the possibility of storing a ``label`` or a ``description`` to any AiiDA Node. However, these properties are defined when the Node is created, and it is not possible to modify them after the Node has been stored.

The Node ``comment`` provides a simple way to have a more dynamic management of comments, in which any user can write a comment on the Node, or modify it or delete it.

The ``verdi comment`` provides a set of methods that are used to manipulate the comments:

* **add**: add a new comment to a Node.
* **update**: modify a comment.
* **show**: show the existing comments attached to the Node.
* **remove**: remove a comment.



.. _completioncommand:

``verdi completioncommand``
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Prints the string to be copied and pasted to the bashrc in order to allow for
autocompletion of the verdi commands.


.. _computer:

``verdi computer``

  *  **show**: shows the details of an installed computer
  *  **list**: list all installed computers
  *  **enable**: to enable a computer. If the computer is disabled, the daemon will not try to connect to the computer, so it will not retrieve or launch calculations. Useful if a computer is under mantainance. 
  *  **disable**: disable a computer (see enable for a larger description)
  *  **rename**: changes the name of a computer.
  * **update**: change configuration of a computer. Works only if the computer node is a disconnected node in the database (has not been used yet).
  *  **delete**: deletes a computer node. Works only if the computer node is a disconnected node in the database (has not been used yet)


.. _daemon:

``verdi daemon``
++++++++++++++++
Manages the daemon, i.e. the process that runs in background and that manages 
submission/retrieval of calculations.

  *  **start**: starts the daemon.
    
  *  **stop**: stops the daemon
  
  *  **restart**: restarts the daemon.
  
  *  **configureuser**: sets the user which is running the daemon. See the installation guide for more details.

# For the container that includes the services, aiida-prepare.sh script is called as soon as the RabbitMQ startup script has
# been launched, but it can take a while for the RMQ service to come up. If ``verdi presto`` is called straight away
# it is possible it tries to connect to the service before that and it will configure the profile without a broker.
# Here we use s6-notifyoncheck to do the polling healthy check of the readyness of RMQ service.

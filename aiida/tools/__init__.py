"""
Tools to operate on AiiDA ORM class instances

What functionality should go directly in the ORM class in `aiida.orm` and what in `aiida.tools`?

    - The ORM class should define basic functions to set and get data from the object
    - More advanced functionality to operate on the ORM class instances can be placed in `aiida.tools`
        to prevent the ORM namespace from getting too cluttered.

.. note:: Modules in this sub package may require the database environment to be loaded

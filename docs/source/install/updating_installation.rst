Instructions
============

.. warning::

    The following instructions are how to update from ``v0.12.*`` to ``v1.0.0``.
    Each version increase may come with its own necessary migrations and you should only ever update the version by one at a time.
    To find the instructions for older versions, refer to the :ref:`table below<update_older_versions>`.

1. Finish all running calculations. After migrating your database, you will not be able to resume unfinished calculations. Data of finished calculations will of course be automatically migrated.
2. Finish all running legacy workflows. The legacy workflows are completely deprecated and all data will be removed from your database, so make sure to create a backup (see point 5).
3. Enter the python environment where AiiDA is installed
4. Stop the daemon using ``verdi daemon stop``
5. Create a backup of your :ref:`database and repository<backup>`

.. warning::

    Once you have migrated your database, you can no longer go back to an older version of ``aiida-core``, unless you restore your database and repository from a backup of course.
    In addition, the data migration can take quite some time depending on the size of your database, so please be patient.
    Big databases of multiple millions of nodes can take up to a few hours to migrate.

6. Update your ``aiida-core`` installation

    - If you have installed AiiDA through ``pip`` simply run: ``pip install --upgrade aiida-core``
    - If you have installed from the git repository using ``pip install -e .``, first delete all the ``.pyc`` files (``find . -name "*.pyc" -delete``) before updating your branch.

7. Finally, after having upgraded the installation, migrate your database with ``verdi -p <profile_name> database migrate``

After the database migration finishes, you will be able to continue working with your existing data.
However, :ref:`backwards incompatible changes<updating_backward_incompatible_changes>` were introduced in the python API, so you probably will have to update your code and installed plugins.


.. _updating_backward_incompatible_changes:

Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

The following list covers the most important backward incompatible changes between ``aiida-core==0.12.*`` and ``aiida-core==1.0.0``.

ORM
---

In order to define a clearer interface for users to the AiiDA entities, and allow (in the future) to swap between different profiles, the underlying hierarchy of nodes and links has been reworked (and a new paradigm has been implemented, with a "frontend" class that all users will interact with, and a "backend" class that users should never use directly, that implements the interaction to the database with a common interface, independent of the underlying ORM).
The reorganisation of nodes and linktypes is mostly invisible to the user, but existing import statements will need to be updated.

-  Non-storable input ports are now markable as such through the ``non_db`` keyword `[#1105] <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/1105>`__


Inline calculations
-------------------

-  The ``make_inline`` and ``optional_inline`` decorators have been replaced by ``calcfunction``. `[#2203] <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/2203>`__


``JobCalculation``
------------------

In the new engine, it is not possible to launch calculation jobs by first creating an instance of the Calculation and then calling the ``calculation.use_xxx`` methods, as it was common in early versions of AiiDA.
Instead, you need to pass the correct Calculation class to the ``run`` or ``submit`` function, passing the nodes to link as input as ``kwargs``.
For the past few versions, we have kept back-compatibility by supporting both ways of submitting. In version 1.0 we have decided to keep only one single way of submitting calculations for simplicity.

-  ``JobCalculation`` has been replaced by ``CalcJob`` process class `[#2389] <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/2389>`__
-  Custom methods on the node class should now be implemented through a ``CalculationTools`` plugin `[#2331] <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/2331>`__
-  Explicit ``set_`` methods of the ``JobCalculation`` have been replaced with generic ``set_option`` method `[#2361] <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/2361>`__
-  Explicit ``get_`` methods of the ``JobCalculation`` have been replaced with generic ``get_option`` method `[#1961] <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/1961>`__
-  New calculation job states have been introduced set as an attribute, only to be used for querying `[#2389] <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/2389>`__
-  The ``DbCalcState`` table that recorded the old job state of ``JobCalculations`` has been removed `[#2389] <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/2389>`__


``Parser``
----------

-  ``parse_from_retrieved`` has been renamed to ``parse``. In addition the arguments and return signatures have changed, for details see the PR `[#2397] <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/2397>`__


``WorkChain``
-------------

-  The free function ``submit`` in any ``WorkChain`` should be replaced with ``self.submit``.
-  The future returned by ``submit`` no longer has the ``pid`` attribute but rather ``pk``.
-  The ``workfunction`` decorator can only be used for functions that return one of the inputs they receive, for all other use the ``calcfunction``
-  The ``get_inputs_template class`` method has been replaced by ``get_builder``. See the `section on the process builder in the documentation <https://aiida-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts/processes.html#the-process-builder>`__ on how to use it.
-  The ``input_group`` has been deprecated and been replaced by namespaces. See the `section on ports in the documentation <https://aiida-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts/workflows.html#ports-and-portnamespaces>`__ on how to use them.
-  The use of a ``.`` (period) in output keys is not supported in ``Process.out`` because that is now reserved to indicate namespaces.


Legacy workflows
----------------

-  Remove implementation of legacy workflows `[#2379] <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/2379>`__


``verdi``
---------

The ``verdi`` command line interface has been migrated over to a new system (called ``click``), making the interface of all ``verdi`` commands consistent: now the way to specify a node (via a PK, a UUID or a LABEL) is the same for all commands, and command-line options that have the same meaning use the same flags in all commands.
To make this possible, the interface of various verdi commands has been changed to ensure consistency.
Also the output of most commands has been homogenised (e.g. to print errors or warnings always in the same style).
Moreover, some of the commands have been renamed to be consistent with the new names of the classes in AiiDA.

-  Removed ``verdi data plugins`` in favor of ``verdi plugin list`` `[#3114] <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/3114>`__
-  Removed ``verdi code rename`` in favor of ``verdi code relabel`` `[#3114] <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/3114>`__
-  Removed ``verdi code update`` in favor of ``verdi code duplicate`` `[#3114] <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/3114>`__
-  Removed ``verdi work`` in favor of ``verdi process`` `[#2574] <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/2574>`__
-  Removed ``verdi calculation`` in favor of ``verdi process`` and ``verdi calcjob`` `[#2574] <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/2574>`__
-  Removed ``verdi workflows`` `[#2379] <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/2379>`__
-  Deprecated the commands to set and get config options ``verdi devel *property*`` in favor of ``verdi config`` `[#2354] <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/2354>`__
-  ``verdi code show`` no longer shows number of calculations by default to improve performance, with ``--verbose`` flag to restore old behavior `[#1428] <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/1428>`__
- The tab-completion activation for ``verdi`` has changed, simply replace the ``eval "$(verdi completioncommand)"`` line in your activation script with ``eval "$(_VERDI_COMPLETE-source verdi)"``


Daemon
------

-  Each profile now has its own daemon that can be run completely independently in parallel, so ``verdi daemon configureuser`` has been removed `[#1217] <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/1217>`__
-  Replaced ``Celery`` with ``Circus`` as the daemonizer of the daemon `[#1213] <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/1213>`__


Schedulers
----------

-  Renamed ``aiida.daemon.execmanager.job_states`` to ``JOB_STATES``, conforming to python conventions `[#1799] <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/1799>`__
-  Abstract method ``aiida.scheduler.Scheduler._get_detailed_jobinfo_command()`` raises ``aiida.common.exceptions.FeatureNotAvailable`` (was ``NotImplemented``).
-  Moved the ``SchedulerFactory`` to ``aiida.plugins.factories`` `[#2498] <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/2498>`__


Transports
----------

-  Moved the ``TransportFactory`` to ``aiida.plugins.factories`` `[#2498] <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core/pull/2498>`__


Export import
-------------

-  New export archive format introduced ``v0.6``. Older archives will automatically be converted when using ``verdi import``, or alternatively can be manually exported using ``verdi export migrate``


.. _update_older_versions:

Older versions
==============

To determine the current version of your installation use ``verdi --version``.
If the command does not exist, you have an older version of AiiDA, in which case you need to get it from the ``aiida.__init__.py`` file.
Update instructions for older versions can be found in the documentation of the corresponding version:

How to extend the AiiDA REST API
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The AiIDA REST API is made of two main classes:

    - ``App``, inheriting ``flask.Flask``. The latter represents any
      Flask web app, including REST APIs.
    - ``Api``, inheriting ``flask_restful.Api``. This represents the API itself.

Once instanciated both ``Api`` and ``App`` classes into, say, ``app`` and ``api``,
these two objects have to be coupled by adding ``app`` as one of the attributes of ``api``.
As we will see in a moment, we provide a function that, besides other things, does exactly this.

In a Flask API the resources, e.g. *Nodes*, *ProcessNodes*,
etc., are represented by ``flask_restful.Resource``-derived classes.

If you need to include additional endpoints besides those built in the AiiDA REST API you should:

    - create the resource classes that will be bound to the new endpoints;
    - extend the class ``Api`` into a user-defined class to register the new endpoints.
    - (Optional) Extend ``App`` into a user-defined class for finer customization.


Let's provide a minimal example through which we add the endpoint
``/new-endpoint`` supporting two HTTP methods:

    - *GET*: retrieves the latest created Dict object and returns its ``id``,
      ``ctime`` in ISO 8601 format, and ``attributes``.
    - *POST*: creates a ``Dict`` object with placeholder attributes,
      stores it, and returns its ``id``.

Let's assume you've put the code in the file ``example.py``, reading:

.. code-block:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    from aiida.restapi.api import AiidaApi, App
    from aiida.restapi.run_api import run_api
    from flask_restful import Resource

    class NewResource(Resource):
        """
        resource containing GET and POST methods. Description of each method
        follows:

        GET: returns id, ctime, and attributes of the latest created Dict.

        POST: creates a Dict object, stores it in the database,
        and returns its newly assigned id.

        """

        def get(self):
            from aiida.orm import QueryBuilder, Dict

            qb = QueryBuilder()
            qb.append(Dict,
                      project=['id', 'ctime', 'attributes'],
                      tag='pdata')
            qb.order_by({'pdata': {'ctime': "desc"}})
            result = qb.first()

            # Results are returned as a dictionary, datetime objects is
            # serialized as ISO 8601
            return dict(id=result[0],
                        ctime=result[1].isoformat(),
                        attributes=result[2])

        def post(self):
            from aiida.orm import Dict

            params = dict(property1="spam", property2="egg")
            paramsData = Dict(dict=params).store()

            return {'id': paramsData.pk}

    class NewApi(AiidaApi):

        def __init__(self, app=None, **kwargs):
            """
            This init serves to add new endpoints to the basic AiiDA Api

            """
            super().__init__(app=app, **kwargs)

            self.add_resource(NewResource, '/new-endpoint/', strict_slashes=False)

    # processing the options and running the app

    import aiida.restapi.common as common
    from aiida import load_profile

    CONFIG_DIR = common.__path__[0]

    import click
    @click.command()
    @click.option('-P', '--port', type=click.INT, default=5000,
        help='Port number')
    @click.option('-H', '--hostname', default='127.0.0.1',
        help='Hostname')
    @click.option('-c','--config-dir','config',type=click.Path(exists=True), default=CONFIG_DIR,
        help='the path of the configuration directory')
    @click.option('--debug', 'debug', is_flag=True, default=False,
        help='run app in debug mode')
    @click.option('--wsgi-profile', 'wsgi_profile', is_flag=True, default=False,
        help='to use WSGI profiler middleware for finding bottlenecks in web application')
    def newendpoint(**kwargs):
        """
        runs the REST api
        """
        # Invoke the runner
        run_api(App, NewApi, **kwargs)


    # main program
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        """
        Run the app with the provided options. For example:
        python example.py --hostname=127.0.0.2 --port=6000
        """

        load_profile()
        newendpoint()

Let us dissect the previous code explaining each part. First things first: the imports.

.. code-block:: python

    from aiida.restapi.api import AiidaApi, App
    from aiida.restapi.run_api import run_api
    from flask_restful import Resource

To start with, we import the base classes to be extended/employed: ``AiidaApi`` and ``App``.
For simplicity, it is advisable to import the method ``run_api``, as it provides an interface
to configure the Api, parse command-line arguments, and couple the two classes representing the Api
and the App. However, you can refer to the documentation of
`flask_restful <https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/>`_ to configure and hook-up an
Api through its built-in methods.

Then we define a class representing the additional resource:

.. code-block:: python

    class NewResource(Resource):
        """
        resource containing GET and POST methods. Description of each method
        follows:

        GET: returns id, ctime, and attributes of the latest created Dict.

        POST: creates a Dict object, stores it in the database,
        and returns its newly assigned id.

        """

        def get(self):
            from aiida.orm import QueryBuilder, Dict

            qb = QueryBuilder()
            qb.append(Dict,
                      project=['id', 'ctime', 'attributes'],
                      tag='pdata')
            qb.order_by({'pdata': {'ctime': "desc"}})
            result = qb.first()

            # Results are returned as a dictionary, datetime objects is
            # serialized as ISO 8601
            return dict(id=result[0],
                        ctime=result[1].isoformat(),
                        attributes=result[2])

        def post(self):
            from aiida.orm import Dict

            params = dict(property1="spam", property2="egg")
            paramsData = Dict(dict=params).store()

            return {'id': paramsData.pk}

The class ``NewResource`` contains two methods: ``get`` and ``post``.
The names chosen for these functions are not arbitrary but fixed
by ``Flask`` to individuate the functions that respond to HTTP request
of type GET and POST, respectively.
In other words, when the API receives a GET (POST) request to the
URL ``new-endpoint``, the function ``NewResource.get()`` (``NewResource.post()``)
will be executed.
The HTTP response is constructed around the data returned by these functions.
The data, which are packed as dictionaries, are serialized by Flask as a JSON
stream of data. All the Python built-in types can be serialized by Flask
(e.g. ``int``, ``float``, ``str``, etc.), whereas for serialization of custom types
we let you refer to the `Flask documentation <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/>`_ .
The documentation of Flask is the main source of information also for topics
such as customization of HTTP responses, construction of custom URLs
(e.g. accepting parameters), and more advanced serialization issues.

Whenever you face the need to handle errors, consider to use the AiiDA
REST API-specific exceptions already defined in  :py:class:`aiida.restapi.common.exceptions`.
The reason will become clear slightly later in this section.

Once the new resource is defined, we have to register it to the API by assigning
it one (or more) endpoint(s).
This is done in the ``__init__()`` of ``NewApi`` by means of the method ``add_resource()``:

.. code-block:: python

    class NewApi(AiidaApi):

        def __init__(self, app=None, **kwargs):
            """
            This init serves to add new endpoints to the basic AiiDA Api

            """
            super().__init__(app=app, **kwargs)

            self.add_resource(NewResource, '/new-endpoint/', strict_slashes=False)

In our original intentions, the main (if not the only) purpose of overriding the
``__init__()`` method is to register new resources to the API.
In fact, the general form of ``__init__()`` is meant to be:

.. code-block:: python

    class NewApi(AiidaApi):

        def __init__(self, app=None, **kwargs):

            super())

            self.add_resource( ... )
            self.add_resource( ... )
            self.add_resource( ... )

            ...

In the example, indeed, the only characteristic line is
:python:`self.add_resource(NewResource, '/new-endpoint/', strict_slashes=False)`.
Anyway, the method ``add_resource()`` is defined and documented in `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/>`_.

Finally, the ``main`` code configures and runs the API:

.. code-block:: python

    import aiida.restapi.common as common
    from aiida import load_profile

    CONFIG_DIR = common.__path__[0]

    import click
    @click.command()
    @click.option('-P', '--port', type=click.INT, default=5000,
        help='Port number')
    @click.option('-H', '--hostname', default='127.0.0.1',
        help='Hostname')
    @click.option('-c','--config-dir','config',type=click.Path(exists=True), default=CONFIG_DIR,
        help='the path of the configuration directory')
    @click.option('--debug', 'debug', is_flag=True, default=False,
        help='run app in debug mode')
    @click.option('--wsgi-profile', 'wsgi_profile', is_flag=True, default=False,
        help='to use WSGI profiler middleware for finding bottlenecks in web application')

    def newendpoint(**kwargs):
        """
        runs the REST api
        """
        # Invoke the runner
        run_api(App, NewApi, **kwargs)

    # main program
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        """
        Run the app with the provided options. For example:
        python example.py --host=127.0.0.2 --port=6000
        """

        load_profile()
        newendpoint()

The `click package <https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/>`_ is used to provide a
a nice command line interface to process the options and handle the default values to
pass to the ``newendpoint`` function.

The method ``run_api()`` accomplishes several functions:
it couples the API to an instance of ``flask.Flask``, namely, the Flask fundamental
class representing a web app. Consequently, the app is configured and, if required, hooked up.
The spirit of ``run_api`` is to take all the ingredients to setup an API and use them
to build up a command-line utility that serves to hook it up.

It requires as inputs:

    - the classes representing the Api and the App. We strongly suggest to pass to
      ``run_api()`` the :py:class:`aiida.restapi.api.App` class, inheriting from
      ``flask.Flask``, as it handles correctly AiiDA RESTApi-specific exceptions.

    - positional arguments representing the command-line arguments/options,
      passed by the click function. Types, defaults and help strings can be set in
      the ``@click.option`` definitions, and will be handled by the command line call.


You should know few more things before using the script:

    - If you want to customize further the error handling, you can take inspiration
      by looking at the definition of ``App`` and create your derived class ``NewApp(App)``.


    - the supported command line options are identical to those of ``verdi restapi``.
      Use ``verdi restapi --help`` for their full documentation.
      If you want to add more options or modify the existing ones,
      create you custom runner taking inspiration from ``run_api``.

It is time to run ``example.py``. Type in a terminal

.. code-block:: bash

    chmod +x example.py
    ./example.py --host=127.0.0.2 --port=6000

You should read the message

.. code-block:: bash

   * Running on http://127.0.0.2:6000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

To route a request to the API from a terminal you can employ ``curl``.
Alternatively, you can use any REST client providing a GUI.
Let us first ask for the latest created node through the GET method:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl http://127.0.0.2:6000/api/v4/new-endpoint/ -X GET

The form of the output (and only the form) should resemble

.. code-block:: python

    {
        "attributes": {
            "binding_energy_per_substructure_per_unit_area_units": "eV/ang^2",
            "binding_energy_per_substructure_per_unit_area": 0.0220032273047497
        },
        "ctime": "2017-04-05T16:01:06.227942+00:00",
        "id": 403504
    }

whereas the actual values of the response dictionary as well as the internal
structure of the attributes field will be in general very different.

Now, let us create a node through the POST method, and check it again through GET:

.. code-block:: python

    curl http://127.0.0.2:6000/api/v4/new-endpoint/ -X POST
    {"id": 410618}
    curl http://127.0.0.2:6000/api/v4/new-endpoint/ -X GET
    {
        "attributes": {
            "property1": "spam",
            "property2": "egg"
        },
        "ctime": "2017-06-20T15:36:56.320180+00:00",
        "id": 410618
    }

The POST request triggers the creation of a new ``Dict`` node,
as confirmed by the response to the GET request.

As a final remark, there might be circumstances in which you do not want to use the internal werkzeug-based server.
For example, you might want to run the app through Apache using a wsgi script.
In this case, simply use ``configure_api`` to return a custom object ``api``:

.. code-block:: python

    api = configure_api(App, MycloudApi, **kwargs)


The ``app`` can be retrieved by ``api.app``.
This snippet of code becomes the fundamental block of a *wsgi* file used by Apache as documented in  :ref:`restapi_apache`.
Moreover, we recommend to consult the documentation of `mod_wsgi <https://modwsgi.readthedocs.io/>`_.

.. note::
    Optionally, create a click option for the variable ``catch_internal_server`` to be ``False`` in order to let exceptions (including python tracebacks) bubble up to the apache error log.
    This can be particularly useful when the app is still under heavy development.

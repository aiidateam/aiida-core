    """Interface to the file repository of a node instance.

    This is the compatibility layer between the `Node` class and the `Repository` class. The repository in principle has
    no concept of immutability, so it is implemented here. Any mutating operations will raise a `ModificationNotAllowed`
    exception if the node is stored. Otherwise the operation is just forwarded to the repository instance.

    The repository instance keeps an internal mapping of the file hierarchy that it maintains, starting from an empty
    hierarchy if the instance was constructed normally, or from a specific hierarchy if reconstructred through the
    ``Repository.from_serialized`` classmethod. This is only the case for stored nodes, because unstored nodes do not
    have any files yet when they are constructed. Once the node get's stored, the repository is asked to serialize its
    metadata contents which is then stored in the ``repository_metadata`` attribute of the node in the database. This
    layer explicitly does not update the metadata of the node on a mutation action. The reason is that for stored nodes
    these actions are anyway forbidden and for unstored nodes, the final metadata will be stored in one go, once the
    node is stored, so there is no need to keep updating the node metadata intermediately. Note that this does mean that
    ``repository_metadata`` does not give accurate information as long as the node is not yet stored.

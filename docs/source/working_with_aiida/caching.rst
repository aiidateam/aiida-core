Enabling caching
----------------

There are numerous reasons why you may need to re-run calculations youâ€™ve already done before.
Since AiiDA stores the full provenance of each calculation, it can detect whether a calculation has been run before and reuse its outputs without wasting computational resources.
This is what we mean by **caching** in AiiDA.

Caching is **not enabled by default**.
In order to enable caching for your AiiDA profile (here called ``aiida2``), place the following ``cache_config.yml`` file in your ``.aiida`` configuration folder:

.. code:: yaml

    aiida2:
      default: True

From this point onwards, when you launch a new calculation, AiiDA will compare its hash (depending both on the type of calculation and its inputs, see :ref:`caching_matches`) against other calculations already present in your database.
If another calculation with the same hash is found, AiiDA will reuse its results without repeating the actual calculation.

In order to ensure that the provenance graph with and without caching is the same, AiiDA creates both a new calculation node and a copy of the output data nodes as shown in :numref:`fig_caching`.

.. _fig_caching:
.. figure:: include/images/caching.png
  :align: center
  :height: 350px

  When reusing the results of a calculation **C** for a new calculation **C'**, AiiDA simply makes a copy of the result nodes and links them up as usual.

.. note::

    AiiDA uses the *hashes* of the input nodes **D1** and **D2** when searching the calculation cache.
    I.e. if the input of **C'** were new nodes **D1'** and **D2'** with the same content (hash) as **D1**, **D2**, the cache would trigger as well.


.. note:: Caching is **not** implemented at the WorkChain/workfunction level (see :ref:`caching_limitations` for details).


.. _caching_matches:

How are nodes hashed?
---------------------

*Hashing* is turned on by default, i.e. all nodes in AiiDA are hashed (see also :ref:`devel_controlling_hashing`).
The hash of a ``Data`` node is computed from:

* all attributes of the node, except the ``_updatable_attributes`` and ``_hash_ignored_attributes``
* the ``__version__`` of the package which defined the node class
* the content of the repository folder of the node
* the UUID of the computer, if the node is associated with one

The hash of a :class:`~aiida.orm.ProcessNode` includes, on top of this, the hashes of all of its input ``Data`` nodes.

Once a node is stored in the database, its hash is stored in the ``_aiida_hash`` extra, and this extra is used to find matching nodes.
If a node of the same class with the same hash already exists in the database, this is considered a cache match.

Use the :meth:`~aiida.orm.nodes.Node.get_hash` method to check the hash of any node.

In order to figure out why a calculation is *not* being reused, the :meth:`~aiida.orm.nodes.Node._get_objects_to_hash` method may be useful:

.. ipython::
    :verbatim:

    In [5]: calc=load_node(1234)

    In [6]: calc.get_hash()
    Out[6]: '62eca804967c9428bdbc11c692b7b27a59bde258d9971668e19ccf13a5685eb8'

    In [7]: calc._get_objects_to_hash()
    Out[7]:
    ['1.0.0b4',
     {'resources': {'num_machines': 2, 'default_mpiprocs_per_machine': 28},
      'parser_name': 'cp2k',
      'linkname_retrieved': 'retrieved'},
     <aiida.common.folders.Folder at 0x1171b9a20>,
     '6850dc88-0949-482e-bba6-8b11205aec11',
     {'code': 'f6bd65b9ca3a5f0cf7d299d9cfc3f403d32e361aa9bb8aaa5822472790eae432',
      'parameters': '2c20fdc49672c3505cebabacfb9b1258e71e7baae5940a80d25837bee0032b59',
      'structure': 'c0f1c1d1bbcfc7746dcf7d0d675904c62a5b1759d37db77b564948fa5a788769',
      'parent_calc_folder': 'e375178ceeffcde086546d3ddbce513e0527b5fa99993091b2837201ad96569c'}]


Configuration
-------------

Class level
...........

Besides an on/off switch per profile, the ``.aiida/cache_config.yml`` provides control over caching at the level of specific calculations using their corresponding entry point strings (see the output of ``verdi plugin list aiida.calculations``):

.. code:: yaml

    profile-name:
      default: False
      enabled:
        - aiida.calculations:quantumespresso.pw
      disabled:
        - aiida.calculations:templatereplacer

In this example, caching is disabled by default, but explicitly enabled for calculaions of the ``PwCalculation`` class, identified by the ``aiida.calculations:quantumespresso.pw`` entry point string.
It also shows how to disable caching for particular calculations (which has no effect here due to the profile-wide default).

Instance level
..............

Even when caching is turned off for a given calculation type, you can enable it on a case-by-case basis by using the :class:`~aiida.manage.caching.enable_caching` context manager for testing purposes:

.. code:: python

    from aiida.engine import run
    from aiida.manage.caching import enable_caching
    with enable_caching(identifier='aiida.calculations:templatereplacer'):
       run(...)

.. warning::

    This affects only the current python interpreter and won't change the behavior of the daemon workers.
    This means that this technique is only useful when using :py:class:`~aiida.engine.run`, and **not** with :py:class:`~aiida.engine.submit`.

If you suspect a node is being reused in error (e.g. during development), you can also manually *prevent* a specific node from being reused:

1. Load one of the nodes you suspect to be a clone.
   Check that :meth:`~aiida.orm.nodes.Node.get_cache_source` returns a UUID.
   If it returns `None`, the node was not cloned.
2. Clear the hashes of all nodes that are considered identical to this node:

    .. code:: python

        for n in node.get_all_same_nodes():
            n.clear_hash()
3. Run your calculation again. The node in question should no longer be reused.


.. _caching_limitations:

Limitations
-----------

#. Workflow nodes are not cached. In the current design this follows from the requirement that the provenance graph be independent of whether caching is enabled or not:

   * **Calculation nodes:** Calculation nodes can have data inputs and create new data nodes as outputs.
     In order to make it look as if a cloned calculation produced its own outputs, the output nodes are copied and linked as well.
   * **Workflow nodes:** Workflows differ from calculations in that they can *return* an input node or an output node created by a calculation.
     Since caching does not care about the *identity* of input nodes but only their *content*, it is not straightforward to figure out which node to return in a cached workflow.

   For the moment, this limitation is acceptable since the runtime of AiiDA WorkChains is usually dominated by expensive calculations, which are covered by the current caching mechanism.

#. The caching mechanism for calculations *should* trigger only when the inputs and the calculation to be performed are exactly the same.
   While AiiDA's hashes include the version of the python package containing the calculation/data classes, it cannot detect cases where the underlying python code was changed without increasing the version number.
   Another edge case would be if the parser lives in a different python package than the calculation (calculation nodes store the name of the parser used but not the version of the package containing the parser).

Finally, while caching saves unnecessary computations, it does not save disk space: The output nodes of the cached calculation are full copies of the original outputs.
The plan is to add data deduplication as a global feature at the repository and database level (independent of caching).

"""Variables to set up in the JSON file
------------------------------------

 * ``periodicity`` (in days): The backup runs periodically for a number of days
   defined in the periodicity variable. The purpose of this variable is to limit
   the backup to run only on a few number of days and therefore to limit the
   number of files that are backed up at every round. e.g. ``"periodicity": 2``
   Example: if you have files in the AiiDA repositories created in the past 30
   days, and periodicity is 15, the first run will backup the files of the first
   15 days; a second run of the script will backup the next 15 days, completing
   the backup (if it is run within the same day). Further runs will only backup
   newer files, if they are created.

 * ``oldest_object_backedup`` (timestamp or null): This is the timestamp of the
   oldest object that was backed up. If you are not aware of this value or if it
   is the first time that you start a backup up for this repository, then set
   this value to ``null``. Then the script will search the creation date of the
   oldest workflow or node object in the database and it will start
   the backup from that date. E.g. ``"oldest_object_backedup":
   "2015-07-20 11:13:08.145804+02:00"``

 * ``end_date_of_backup``: If set, the backup script will backup files that
   have a modification date until the value specified by this variable. If not
   set, the ending of the backup will be set by the following variable
   (``days_to_backup``) which specifies how many days to backup from the start
   of the backup. If none of these variables are set (``end_date_of_backup``
   and ``days_to_backup``), then the end date of backup is set to the current
   date. E.g. ``"end_date_of_backup": null`` or ``"end_date_of_backup":
   "2015-07-20 11:13:08.145804+02:00"``


 * ``days_to_backup``: If set, you specify how many days you will backup from
   the starting date of your backup. If it set to ``null`` and also
   ``end_date_of_backup`` is set to ``null``, then the end date of the backup
   is set to the current date. You can not set ``days_to_backup``
   & ``end_date_of_backup`` at the same time (it will lead to an error).
   E.g. ``"days_to_backup": null`` or ``"days_to_backup": 5``

 * ``backup_length_threshold`` (in hours): The backup script runs in rounds and
   on every round it backs-up a number of days that are controlled primarily by
   ``periodicity`` and also by ``end_date_of_backup`` / ``days_to_backup``,
   for the last backup round. The ``backup_length_threshold`` specifies the
   lowest acceptable round length. This is important for the end of the backup.

 * ``backup_dir``: The destination directory of the backup. e.g.
   ``"backup_dir": "/scratch/aiida_user/backup_script_dest"``
